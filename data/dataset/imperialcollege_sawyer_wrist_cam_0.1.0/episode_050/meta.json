  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The robot must first perceive and localize an apple on a blue tabletop. After confirming its visibility, it positions its gripper above the apple and computes a top-down grasp pose. It then closes the gripper to secure the apple and verifies the object is held. Next, the robot localizes the pot, moves above it, and executes a placing maneuver to release the apple inside, finally retreating its tool and confirming placement. The main scene includes a red apple and a metallic pot, with placement on a blue surface and progressive movement sequence.",
