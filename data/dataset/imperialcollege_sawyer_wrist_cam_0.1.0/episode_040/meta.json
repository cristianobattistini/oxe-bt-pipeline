  "task_summary": "The robot is tasked to pick up the kettle, starting from visual localization, approaching, grasping and lifting the object as evidenced across the contact-sheet frames.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This sequence involves a robot arm detecting and picking up a kettle from a blue surface. The process begins with visual search and localization, followed by approach and alignment over the kettle, preparing the gripper, computing a top-down grasp, and executing a stable grasp. The final step verifies successful lift-off, indicating the kettle is held securely. The contact-sheet frames illustrate the kettle's position and orientation throughout this procedure. Robust perception and compliant interaction are priorities.",
