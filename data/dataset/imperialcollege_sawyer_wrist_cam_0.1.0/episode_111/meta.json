    "overview": "This task consists of visually locating a white pan lying on a blue surface, approaching and aligning the gripper, and executing a controlled top grasp to pick up the pan. The robot relies on object detection, centering over the pan, lowering until contact, and closing the gripper with gentle force, before verifying a stable grasp. The scene shows a single pan dominant in all frames, with clear unobstructed access for the arm. The process is sequential, minimizing disturbances and ensuring a reliable pick-up. The episode appears free from obstacles or occlusions.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pan is fully visible and isolated on the workspace surface",
      "Robot gripper is initially open",
      "Camera and perception systems operational"
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Check visibility of the pan in the workspace",
      "If not visible, scan using raster pattern",
      "Detect pan for pose estimation",
      "Open gripper",
      "Move TCP above the pan with an offset",
      "Compute grasp pose using top-grasp strategy",
      "Approach and align with tight tolerance",
      "Lower until gentle contact with pan",
      "Close gripper with light force",
      "Verify grasp is stable and pan is held"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Pan is firmly grasped and elevated by the robot",
      "No accidental sliding or dropping upon lift"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If pan not detected: retry scan",
      "If grasp not stable: repeat grasping sequence",
      "If contact not made: realign and lower again"
    ],
    "termination": "Task terminates when pan is securely grasped, as confirmed by stability and object-in-gripper conditions."
