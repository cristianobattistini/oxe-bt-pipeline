  "task_summary": "The robot is tasked to swipe a small spherical object using its end-effector across a flat blue surface, following a left-to-right translation motion.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a robot (likely Sawyer) equipped with a wrist camera, performing a swipe motion on a small ball located on a blue surface. The sequence involves locating the ball, aligning the tool, grasping lightly, moving laterally in the x direction, and releasing the object at the goal position. No visible obstacles are present, and the action is characterized by a smooth motion with minimal force applied.",
