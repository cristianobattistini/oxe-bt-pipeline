  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, a robotic arm is instructed to pick up a white pan with a black handle resting on a blue surface. The robot must locate the pan, approach from above, compute a suitable grasp, precisely align, and close the gripper to achieve a secure pick-up. Visual cues and object proximity dominate the process, and stable grasp is required. The robot retries visual search if the pan isn't immediately visible.",
