  "task_summary": "The robot perceives, approaches, aligns with, and opens a lid in a sequential manner.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a robotic manipulator tasked to open a lid. The sequence begins with visual perception of the lid, followed by approach and alignment maneuvers. Once in position, the robot executes an open container action on the lid, likely by lifting or tilting. The scene consists of a white circular lid against a blue background; no other objects are apparent. Safety and precise timing are considered, given the uncluttered environment.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Lid is present within the manipulator's reachable workspace.",
      "Lid is initially closed and visible or can be detected."

      "Approach and align with the lid for grasp/manipulation.",
      "Open the container by actuating the lid.",
      "Wait briefly to ensure state change is stable."

      "Lid is fully separated from its closed state.",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If the lid is not detected, re-attempt detection.",
      "If approach fails, abort.",
      "If opening fails, do not force to prevent damage."
    ],
    "termination": "After the lid is opened and a brief wait, the episode completes."
