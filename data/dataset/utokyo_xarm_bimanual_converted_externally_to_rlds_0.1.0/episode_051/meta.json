  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a dual-armed robot operating on artificial grass. Its goal is to unfold a wrinkled towel placed centrally. The robot starts by perceiving and localizing the towel, then approaches with both grippers, grasps opposing ends, and executes a coordinated pull to fully extend the towel flat. After the manipulation, the robot releases and retreats. The process demands sufficient perception, bimanual coordination, and reliability, as evidenced by sequential image frames where the towel transitions from wrinkled to fully unfolded.",
