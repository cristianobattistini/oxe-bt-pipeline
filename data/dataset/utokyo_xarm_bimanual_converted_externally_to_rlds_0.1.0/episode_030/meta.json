    "overview": "This sequence involves a bimanual xArm robot operating in a workspace with a pink towel on a green mat. The robot's main purpose is to approach and align with the towel, starting from a ready pose. No grasp or manipulation occurs. The robot must first detect (or verify visibility of) the towel, then move above it, and finally approach closely, aligning to complete 'reaching'. The sequence avoids any interaction or placement.",
