    "overview": "This episode features a bimanual robot executing a reach motion towards a towel laid out on a surface. The workspace contains a towel over simulated grass or mat. The robot begins away from the towel and, via perception and motion primitives, approaches to hover at or above the towel's surface, aligning the end effector for possible subsequent manipulation.",
