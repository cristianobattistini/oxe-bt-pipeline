  "task_summary": "This episode demonstrates a dual-arm robot unfolding a wrinkled towel on a table, progressing through perception, approach, grasp, unfolding, and placement steps.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this scenario, a dual-arm robot is tasked to unfold a wrinkled towel placed on a green table surface. The robot first locates and aligns with the towel, computes a grasp pose, then grasps and manipulates it to unfold across the table. The process involves perception, grasping from the top, unfolding using a pushing strategy, placing the towel down smoothly, and retreating. The primary objective is to flatten the towel without leaving wrinkles.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Towel is initially wrinkled and placed on table within robot's reach.",
      "Robot arms and grippers are operational and calibrated.",

      "Place towel smoothly on surface.",
      "Open gripper to release towel.",

    "success_criteria": [
      "Towel is spread flat with minimal wrinkles.",
      "Towel lies on table within defined area.",
      "Robot releases towel and moves away."

      "Towel not detected: retry scanning up to 3 times.",
      "Grasp not stable: recompute grasp and retry.",
      "Partial unfolding: repeat unfold step if needed."
