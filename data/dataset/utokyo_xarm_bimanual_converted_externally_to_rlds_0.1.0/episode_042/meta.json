    "overview": "This episode features a bimanual robot operating in a tabletop scene with a pink towel as the goal object. The robot begins above the workspace and sequentially performs perception, alignment, and approach to bring its end-effector near the towel. All motions and queries are strictly based on vision and spatial feedback to ensure correct alignment. Scenes show systematic progress from workspace observation to towel proximity. Environment objects remain stationary; the towel is the designated reachable target.",
