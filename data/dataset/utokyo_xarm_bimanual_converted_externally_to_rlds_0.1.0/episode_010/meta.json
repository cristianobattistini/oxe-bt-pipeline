  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode tasks a bimanual robot arm system to reach a towel laid out horizontally on a workspace. The sequence involves perceiving the towel's location, approaching it via controlled movement, and verifying proximity. No grasp is involved, the robot ends with its end-effector close to or above the towel, as confirmed by the final frame. The robot acts in a known environment with no visible obstacles, following a perception and approach routine typical for object-reaching tasks.",
