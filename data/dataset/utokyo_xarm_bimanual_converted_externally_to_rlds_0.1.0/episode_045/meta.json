  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This scenario involves a robotic manipulator positioned in front of a workspace containing a pink towel. The robot starts above the workspace, then detects the towel, approaches it vertically, and completes a precise alignment step to conclude the 'reach' task. There is no grasp or manipulation; the goal is to reach and make contact or align with the towel. No tool change is required, and there are no obstacles. Visual detection and approach accuracy are emphasized.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is powered on and homed above workspace.",
      "Towel is visible and placed on table below the robot.",
      "Workspace is clear of obstructions."

      "Verify towel visibility using vision.",
      "Fallback to scanning if not visible.",
      "Detect the towel precisely.",

      "Align and approach the towel closely."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "The robot's end-effector is precisely above and aligned with the towel.",
      "Towel is within expected workspace area.",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Failure to detect towel – initiate scan and retry.",
      "Approach misalignment – retry or adjust approach.",
      "Workspace occlusions – abort and alert operator."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate when the approach and alignment action completes successfully above the towel."
