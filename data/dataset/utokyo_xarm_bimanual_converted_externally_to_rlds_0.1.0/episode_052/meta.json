  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, a bimanual robot is tasked with reaching a pink towel placed on a green surface. The scene features two arms, but only the left gripper actively approaches the towel. Starting from a neutral pose away from the towel, the robot perceives and verifies the towel's position, then sequentially approaches and aligns to reach it. The process emphasizes robust perception and careful approach, crucial for manipulating soft or deformable objects in constrained settings.",
