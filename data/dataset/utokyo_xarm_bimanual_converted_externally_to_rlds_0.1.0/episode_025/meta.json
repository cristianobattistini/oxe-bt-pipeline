  "task_summary": "The robot visually detects and approaches a towel lying on a workspace, aligning above it to reach the target as specified.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a stationary manipulator reaching a towel positioned on a workspace. The robot sequentially perceives (localizes) the towel, moves above it at an appropriate height to avoid collision, and finally approaches to align its end-effector above the towel. No grasping or manipulation is requested—the goal is simply to reach above the towel. The workspace is uncluttered, and only the towel and table are relevant objects.",
