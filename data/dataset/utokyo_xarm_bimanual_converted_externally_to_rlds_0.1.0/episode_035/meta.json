  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The scene depicts a dual-arm robot operating in a workspace with a pink towel placed on an artificial grass patch. The robot must unfold the towel, which starts with visible wrinkles and overlaps. The process involves visually detecting the towel, approaching and aligning with appropriate grasp positions, executing a grasp using a pinch strategy with minimal force, performing a pulling/unfold action (likely using both arms), and placing the unfolded towel down. This plan is inferred directly from progressive changes in towel geometry across the frames.",
