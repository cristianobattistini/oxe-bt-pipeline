  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a bimanual robot tasked to unfold a wrinkled pink towel on an artificial grass tabletop. The robot uses visual detection to locate the towel, approaches and aligns grippers, grasps a portion with a pinch strategy, then unfolds the towel by pulling and spreading motions. After achieving a mostly flat configuration, the robot places the towel on the surface and retreats, signaling completion. The entire procedure is strictly visible and temporally segmented in 9 frames, which reflect each atomic step. Constraints include minimal force and careful alignment to avoid tearing or re-wrinkling.",
