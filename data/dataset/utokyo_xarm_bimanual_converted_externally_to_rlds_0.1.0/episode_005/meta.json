    "overview": "This episode depicts a bimanual robot tasked with locating, grasping, and sequentially unfolding a soft pink towel arranged with visible wrinkles on a green mat. The scene involves repeated bi-manual grasps and lateral stretches to flatten and unfold the towel. The system must handle compliant object manipulation and maintain stability during each phase.",

      "Recompute grasp on the opposite wrinkled region.",
