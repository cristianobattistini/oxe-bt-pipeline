  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a dual-arm robot identifying a wrinkled towel, grasping it using a pinching strategy, and performing an unfolding action to flatten it on a table. The robot works in a controlled workspace with artificial turf, visual perception, and appropriate manipulation constraints. Successful unfolding is achieved when the towel is laid flat, minimizing visible wrinkles. Constraints include safe manipulation forces and precise positioning to avoid damage or incomplete unfolding.",
