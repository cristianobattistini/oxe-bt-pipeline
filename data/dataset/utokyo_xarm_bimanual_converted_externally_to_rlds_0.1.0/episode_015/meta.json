  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode showcases a bimanual xArm robot tasked with reaching a pink towel positioned on a green mat. The robot starts from a home position above the workspace and proceeds through visual search and detection, followed by vertical and lateral positioning above the towel and alignment. No grasp or manipulation is performed; the primary goal is to reach and align to the towel, as evidenced by the arm's endpoints in the frames.",

      "Robot is powered and initialized",

    "termination": "Tree terminates when the robot is positioned and aligned above the towel, or aborts after action/scan failures."
