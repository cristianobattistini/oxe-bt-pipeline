    "overview": "In this episode, a bimanual robotic manipulator is directed to reach a pink towel on a tabletop. The robot begins with visual search and confirmation for the towel, then progressively aligns and approaches to execute a reliable reach. No grasp or manipulation is required, focusing only on physically reaching and aligning with the towel’s position, as seen in the frames.",
