    "overview": "This episode involves a single-arm manipulator tasked with reaching a towel placed on a workspace. The environment contains the manipulator, a work surface, and a visually distinctive towel, which is the target. The procedure comprises perceiving, localizing, and approaching the towel, with careful alignment at the task's conclusion. Perception failures are managed by visual rescan attempts.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Towel is present and unobstructed on the workspace.",
