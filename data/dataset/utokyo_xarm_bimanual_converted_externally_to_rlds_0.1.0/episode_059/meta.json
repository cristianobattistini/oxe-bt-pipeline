    "overview": "This episode shows a bimanual robotic arm locating and approaching a pink towel placed on a green mat. The robot begins by visually detecting the towel, adjusts its pose using high-precision movements, and finally arrives at the designated 'reach' position above the towel, constrained by stable alignment. No grasp or manipulation is performed; the goal is contactless arrival at the towel's position.",
