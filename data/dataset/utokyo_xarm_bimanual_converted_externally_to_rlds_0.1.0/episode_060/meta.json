  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a bimanual xArm robot positioned above a workspace containing a towel to be reached. The robot starts above the workspace and proceeds by visually detecting the towel, approaching it accurately, and aligning itself for contact, without an explicit grasp. The movement is deliberate, and object localization is periodically verified. The workspace is clear, and the towel is distinct against the background. There are no visible obstacles, but correct spatial perception and control are required.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot arms are powered and home position is set.",
      "Towel is present and distinctly visible on workspace.",
      "Sensors for perception and motion are functional."

      "Move robot end-effector above the towel to a safe height.",
      "Approach and align with the towel using tight tolerance.",
      "Optionally wait/stabilize after move completion."

    "success_criteria": [
      "Robot end-effector is precisely positioned over the towel within allowed tolerance.",
