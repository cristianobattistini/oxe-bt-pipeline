    "overview": "This episode shows a robotic arm executing a 'pour into the mug' task on a tabletop. The robot first locates the mug and the source cup, then moves above the cup, computes and executes a grasp, verifies stability, transfers to above the mug, and pours by tilting the cup over the mug. After pouring, the robot retreats to a safe position. The system relies on vision and standard manipulation primitives. Pour volume and rate are not specified in the instruction or visible in the frames.",
