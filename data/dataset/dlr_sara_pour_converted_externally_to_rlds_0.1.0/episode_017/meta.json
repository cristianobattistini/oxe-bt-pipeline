  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The episode involves a fixed-base robot manipulator equipped with a bottle positioned above a mug, which sits on a table. The robot must detect the mug, move into position above it, and pour the contents of the bottle into the mug with controlled tilt. The table is clear and stationary. The bottle is already held by the robot; no grasping action is required. Key constraints are precise alignment over the mug and stable pour without spills.",

      "Retreat after pouring is complete"
