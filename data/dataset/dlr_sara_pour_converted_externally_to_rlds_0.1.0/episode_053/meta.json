    "overview": "A fixed robotic arm (SARA) is tasked with transferring liquid from a held cup into a mug on a workbench. The scene involves perception and alignment with the mug, positioning the cup above it, and executing a controlled pour. Visual confirmation and recovery strategies are incorporated to handle object detection failures.",
