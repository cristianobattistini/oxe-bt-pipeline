  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode depicts a robot arm executing a pouring task at a laboratory bench. The robot first visually locates a mug, approaches and aligns the end-effector holding a cup above it, and executes a precise pouring motion with a controlled tilt. After completing the pour, the arm retreats from the mug to a safe position. Accurate perception, precise alignment, and smooth controlled motion are essential to ensure a successful pour without spillage.",
