  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a robot arm with a two-finger gripper pouring liquid (or simulated contents) from a handled cup into a mug positioned on a table. The sequence follows perception of both source (cup) and target (mug), approach and alignment over the mug, execution of a pouring motion by tilting the cup with a controlled angle over the mug, and retreating once pouring is complete. Visual alignment and verification steps are implied by the frames.",
