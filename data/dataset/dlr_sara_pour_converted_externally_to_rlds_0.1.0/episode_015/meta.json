  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a manipulator arm executing a controlled pour from a cup into a mug placed on a table. The robot uses visual sensing to confirm the mug's position, moves the cup to an optimal pouring pose above the mug, tilts it to pour at a moderate rate, and finally retreats. The mug and the cup are both present throughout, and there are constraints on arm alignment and safe actuation to avoid spillage or collision.",

      "Mug is present and visibly accessible on the table.",

      "Move the held cup above the mug at a safe offset.",
