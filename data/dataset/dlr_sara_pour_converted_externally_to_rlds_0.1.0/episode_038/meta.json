  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The episode features a robotic arm, SARA, tasked with pouring a liquid (or simulated contents) from a held container into a mug placed on a workbench. The BT begins by ensuring that the mug is reliably detected in the workspace using fallback perception. The arm then moves above the mug, aligning the container for a controlled pour action, tilting the container to a defined angle until the mug is full. Lastly, the arm retreats from the mug to signal task completion. Key roles include perception, precise alignment, pouring with correct tilt and rate, and safe withdrawal.",
