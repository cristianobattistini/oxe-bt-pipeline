  "task_summary": "The robot pours liquid from a cup into a mug. The sequence involves locating the mug, approaching above it, performing the pouring action with the cup, and then retreating.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a stationary robot arm on a workbench pouring liquid from a cup into a mug. The arm first locates the mug (if not visible), then moves above it with the cup in its grasp. Pouring is initiated by tilting the cup to a set angle above the mug. After the liquid transfer, the arm retreats from the mug, marking episode completion. Accuracy and spill avoidance are important, and the robot re-acquires the mug if visibility fails.",
