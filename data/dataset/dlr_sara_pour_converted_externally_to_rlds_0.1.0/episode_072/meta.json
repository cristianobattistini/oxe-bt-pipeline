    "overview": "This episode documents a 6-DoF robotic arm tasked with pouring liquid from a cup into a mug. The workspace features a wooden table, a source cup held by the robot, and a mug as the pouring target. The robot must detect both objects, stably grasp the cup, align above the mug, and perform the pouring gesture by tilting the cup, before retreating to a neutral position. No human interaction is present; the task depends on visual feedback and precise actuation.",
