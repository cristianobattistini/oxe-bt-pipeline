  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A robotic arm is tasked with pouring the contents of a cup into a mug on a workbench. Over the episode, the arm approaches the mug, aligns above it, executes the pouring motion by tilting the cup, and concludes with a retreat. Key objects are the cup held in the gripper and the stationary mug. The actions are constrained by visibility, alignment, and the proper tilt angle required for pouring without spilling.",

      "Cup is grasped in the robot's gripper",

      "Check mug visibility or actively detect its location",
      "Move the cup above the mug at an appropriate height",
