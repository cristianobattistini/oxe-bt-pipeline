  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop robot arm equipped with a parallel gripper performs the task of pouring from a bottle into a mug. The arm first identifies both the mug and the bottle on the workspace. It then approaches, aligns, and grasps the bottle using a side-grasp. Next, it moves the bottle above the mug, executes a controlled pour by tilting, and finally retreats. The steps are sequenced to minimize spill risk and ensure safe manipulation.",

      "The bottle and mug are both present and accessible on the workspace.",

      "Liquid is successfully transferred from the bottle to the mug with minimal spill.",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If the mug or bottle is not visible, the robot retries detection.",
      "If grasp fails, the robot does not proceed to pouring.",
      "In case of perception or minor grasp errors, recovery is attempted via fallback search or re-alignment."
