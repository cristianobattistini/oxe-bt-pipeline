  "task_summary": "The behavior tree controls a robotic arm tasked to pour liquid from a jug into a mug, grounded in a table-top environment. The robot ensures the mug is visible, approaches and aligns above it, performs the pour, and then retreats.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A robotic arm pours a liquid into a mug placed on a table. The sequence includes detecting the mug, approaching and aligning above it, tilting the jug to pour, and then retreating to a safe position. The key objects are a jug (held or attached to the robot’s gripper) and a mug. The mug's precise placement and the arm’s careful movement avoid spillage, reflecting workspace and safety constraints.",
