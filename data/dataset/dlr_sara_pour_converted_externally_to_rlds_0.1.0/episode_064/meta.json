  "task_summary": "A robot arm picks up a cup and pours its contents into a mug by aligning above the mug and actuating the tilt to effect pouring, then retreats.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, the SARA robot arm is tasked with pouring liquid from a cup into a mug placed below it on a wooden workspace. The scene contains the cup held by the gripper, the target mug, and the workspace itself. The robot must perceive and localize the mug, align the cup correctly above it, control the pour action by tilting with precision and sufficient force, then retract once pouring is complete. Accuracy in alignment and stable pouring motion are necessary due to the risk of spillage and missing the mug.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cup is securely held in gripper.",
      "Mug is placed on workspace and visible.",
      "Pour angle and rate appropriate for mug opening.",

      "Detect or verify visibility of the mug (target).",
      "Move gripped cup above the mug.",
      "Precisely align the cup with the mug opening.",
      "Perform pour action: tilt and pour into mug.",
      "Retract the cup away from the mug after pouring."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Liquid is transferred from cup into mug.",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Object not visible: scan for mug and retry detection.",
      "Alignment error: repeat approach and precise alignment.",
      "Pour incomplete: reattempt pouring if possible."
    ],
    "termination": "Robot finishes when cup is retracted and no more liquid transfer is possible, or after time-out."
