  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A collaborative robot arm is tasked to pour the contents of a held cup into a mug placed on a wooden table. The scene involves visual detection and localization of the mug, followed by alignment of the cup over the mug. The robot tilts the cup to pour, ensuring controlled motion and avoiding spills. The episode proceeds with initial perception, approach, verification/alignment, tilt-actuated pouring, and retreat. No explicit force or pour amount modulation is visible; the sequence appears stable throughout.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cup is grasped securely by robot",
