  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a robot arm tasked with pouring the contents of a 'cup' into a 'mug.' The cup is grasped and moved above the mug with precise control. The process involves object detection, approach to both cup and mug, and the pour action itself, aligned for aiming accuracy. After pouring, the robot retreats from the area. The main constraints involve maintaining object visibility, stable grasp, and avoiding spillage during the transfer.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cup is placed on the table and contains pourable material.",
      "Mug is on the table, unobstructed, empty, and visible.",
      "Robot arm is initialized and gripper is able to operate."

      "Pour the contents from the cup into the mug.",
      "Retreat to a neutral position."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Majority of the liquid in the cup is transferred to the mug.",
      "No major spillage is observed.",
      "Robot returns to safe position after pouring."
    ],
