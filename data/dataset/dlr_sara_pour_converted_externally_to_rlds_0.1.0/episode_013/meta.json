  "task_summary": "The robot arm pours liquid from a wooden cup into a white mug on the workbench. It first locates and approaches the mug, then tilts and pours before retreating.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves an industrial robotic arm transferring contents from a wooden cup into a white ceramic mug. The workspace is a wooden table and the scene is static except for the robot. Key objects are the cup (held by the gripper or tool) and the mug (recipient). The robot must visually locate the mug, move to a pouring position above it, tilt the cup at a suitable angle, pour, and return to a neutral pose. Constraints include avoiding spillage and making sure the mug is properly targeted.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cup is firmly grasped by the robot",
      "Mug is present and accessible on the table",
      "No major obstacles around mug position",
      "Robot arm is powered and calibrated"
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Verify mug visibility or detect it using sensors",
      "Move end-effector above the mug at safe offset",
      "Pour from cup into mug by tilting to 45 degrees at normal rate",
      "Retreat arm from mug position once pouring is complete"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Majority of contents transferred into mug without spillage",
      "Pouring motion is completed cleanly",
      "Robot returns to neutral or safe position"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Failure to detect mug: reattempt detection or fallback to backup",
      "Spillage detected: pause, adjust pose, and retry if possible",
      "Object slipping: abort and secure grasp before retrying"
    ],
    "termination": "Task ends when pouring is finished and robot has retreated from mug."
