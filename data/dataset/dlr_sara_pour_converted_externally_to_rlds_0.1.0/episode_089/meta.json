  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a robotic arm executing a pouring task: it locates a mug on a table, approaches it while holding a cup (acting as the pouring vessel), aligns the cup above the mug, and pours the contents into the mug. After pouring, the robot arm retreats to complete the task. Visual feedback is used for mug detection, and actions proceed sequentially.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Mug is present and unobstructed on the table.",

      "Approach and align with the mug opening.",
      "Pour contents from the cup into the mug with a 90 degree tilt.",
      "Retreat from the mug."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Contents are poured from the cup into the mug.",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If mug is not initially visible, the robot will scan up to three times.",
      "If approach or alignment fails, sequence halts.",
      "If pour action times out or fails, robot does not continue, and operator intervention may be required."
