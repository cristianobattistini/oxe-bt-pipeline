  "task_summary": "A robot arm is tasked with pouring the contents from its held container into a mug placed on a table. The tree orchestrates mug localization, approach, pouring, and safety retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, a robotic arm performs the task of pouring liquid into a mug situated on a tabletop workspace. The mug is the target receptacle for the pour, and the robot is equipped with a container (source) mounted in its gripper. Visual detection ensures mug localization, while approach is executed vertically for safety. Pouring is performed via controlled tilt, and the sequence concludes with a retreat, presumably to reduce risk of spillage or collision.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Mug is placed upright and accessible on table",
      "Container/gripper is holding the pour source",
