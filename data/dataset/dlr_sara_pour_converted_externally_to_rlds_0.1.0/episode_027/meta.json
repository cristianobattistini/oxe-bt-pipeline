  "task_summary": "Robotic arm pours the contents from a cup into a mug by approaching, aligning, performing the pour with an appropriate tilt, and then retreating.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The task is to pour the contents of a handled cup into a mug placed on a table using a robotic arm. The robot first locates the mug, moves above and aligns its end effector, then tilts the cup to pour into the mug with a determined angle and pour rate, and finally retreats once pouring is complete. The tabletop workspace is clear except for the objects involved.",

      "Cup is grasped by the robot",
