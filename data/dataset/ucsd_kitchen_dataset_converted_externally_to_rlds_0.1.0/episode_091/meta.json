  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a robot executing the task to place a teapot onto a stove in a kitchen environment. The robot must perceive both objects, approach the teapot precisely, grasp it securely, then transfer and place it on the stove surface. The process leverages onboard vision for detection, sequential arm control for approach and manipulation, and verified grasp stability. Recovery mechanisms are applied after failed perceptions. All actions adhere to physical constraints indicated by the observed scene, including obstacle avoidance and placement alignment.",
