  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode depicts a robot arm interacting with a kitchen oven. The robot must detect and localize the oven door, approach and align with the grasp point, plan a side grasp, execute the grasp, and then pull the oven door open. Each phase leverages visual feedback and motion primitives tailored for rigid handles and hinged doors. Recovery against perception failures is provided via multiple scan attempts, and outcome verification uses the door open sensor. Key constraints include motion safety, reliable grasping, and successful actuation of the door in the correct direction.",
