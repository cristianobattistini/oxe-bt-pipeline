  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a robotic arm operating in a domestic kitchen environment. The robot is to find and grasp a can of spam from the countertop, transport it, and accurately place it into the sink. The process must ensure object detection, stable grasping, motion alignment, and a successful, safe placement. The workspace includes cabinets, a faucet, and visible clutter, so precise control is required.",
    "preconditions": [
      "The spam can is present and accessible on the counter.",
      "The robot is powered, calibrated, and its gripper is empty.",
      "The sink is empty and able to receive the can.",
      "No occluding obstacles between robot and objects."
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Perceive the spam can and confirm visibility.",
      "Approach and align above the can.",
      "Compute grasp pose and open gripper.",
      "Lower until contact and close gripper to secure the can.",
      "Verify grasp stability.",
      "Perceive the sink and move above it.",
      "Place the can in the sink.",
      "Release the can and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Spam can is grasped and no longer on the counter.",
      "Can is released entirely within the confines of the sink.",
      "No objects are dropped en route.",
      "Gripper releases cleanly after placement."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Object not visible: retry scan three times, else abort.",
      "Grasp fails: reattempt from approach, else abort.",
      "Place location not detected: rescan, else abort.",
      "Unexpected collision detected: retreat and recompute path."
    ],
    "termination": "The behavior terminates when the can is securely released in the sink and the arm retreats."
