  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a robotic arm executing a sequence to turn on a kitchen faucet. The environment contains a sink, a faucet with a lever handle, and the robot begins away from the faucet. The arm must perceive the faucet handle, approach it, align for grasping, securely grasp using a twist strategy, rotate the lever to the 'open' position, and safely retreat. All actions are strictly grounded in visual evidence from the 9 contact-sheet frames.",
