  "task_summary": "Robot arm locates the oven door, approaches and aligns to it, then opens the door via appropriate actuation, verifying successful opening and retreating safely.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a robot arm in a kitchen setup tasked to open the oven door. The robot perceives the oven door, plans and executes its approach, aligns its end-effector near the door handle or grasp point, and undertakes the actuation to open the door. Verification post-actuation ensures the oven is open, followed by a safe retreat. Accuracy in perception and alignment is essential for reliable door opening without causing damage or missteps.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Oven door is accessible and visible or scannable",
