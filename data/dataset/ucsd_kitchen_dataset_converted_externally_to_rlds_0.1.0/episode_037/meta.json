  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A manipulator robot must place a teapot from its starting position onto a stove surface in a miniature kitchen environment. The main objects are the teapot and the stove. The arm must detect the teapot, approach and grasp it, transport it through a collision-free path, visually verify the stove's location, align above the surface, and gently release the teapot. Actions are ordered to ensure perception, secure grasp, and safe placement. Recovery mechanisms address perception failures. The robot avoids excessive force and ensures object stability.",
