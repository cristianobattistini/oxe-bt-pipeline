    "overview": "A single-arm robot is tasked with perceiving, grasping, and transferring a canned spam object into the sink in a controlled kitchen environment. The sequence involves object detection, precise grasping using a side approach, and transferring the item over to the sink area. Visual verification ensures accurate placement, and a release followed by a retreat completes the action. The scene consists of a compact kitchen mockup with the spam can and sink clearly visible and accessible.",
