  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The task is set in a kitchen-like scene, with a white robotic arm interacting with a white box placed near a sink. The goal is to move the white box from its initial position on the counter into the sink below. The robot uses a vision-based pipeline to detect, approach, grasp, transfer, and place the box in the sink directly. The scene provides a clear workspace and accessible goal location, with actions constrained by gripper size and workspace. The sequence shown in 9 frames confirms that the placement proceeds without mid-task human intervention or environmental change.",
    "preconditions": [
      "White box present and accessible on the counter.",
