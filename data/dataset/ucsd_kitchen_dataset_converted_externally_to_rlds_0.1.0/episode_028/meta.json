  "task_summary": "The robot locates, grasps, and pulls open the oven door by interacting with its handle, ensuring the container (oven) is open before releasing and retreating.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a manipulator arm operating in a kitchen environment to open the oven door. The robot must first perceive and visually confirm the position of the oven door handle, then approach and align with it precisely. After securing a side grasp, the arm executes a deliberate pull movement to open the hinged door, monitors the state to confirm opening, then releases the handle and retreats. No other kitchen contents are manipulated. The task restricts the robot to gentle interaction, uses visual and force feedback, and is staged to minimize the risk of collision or incomplete opening.",
