  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In a compact kitchen scene, a robotic arm is tasked to open the oven door. The robot must first locate the oven door visually, align itself with the handle, compute a grasp pose, and execute a grasp action. Once the handle is secured, the robot pulls the oven door open and verifies the result. Afterwards, the robot retreats to a safe position. The oven door is horizontal and the handle is likely a bar or recessed type in the lower section.",
