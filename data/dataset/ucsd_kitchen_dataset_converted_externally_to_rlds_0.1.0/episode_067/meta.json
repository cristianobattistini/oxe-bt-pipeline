    "overview": "A robotic arm is tasked with placing a bowl inside a kitchen cabinet. The action sequence involves detecting the bowl, grasping it from above, locating the cabinet, opening it, and placing the bowl inside. The robot must carefully approach, manipulate, and transfer the bowl while managing the cabinet door. The task may require retrying bowl detection if it is not visible and ensures safe handling during grasp and transfer.",
