  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a robot arm interacting with a kitchen environment. The robot must locate a bowl on the counter, pick it up using its gripper, detect the kitchen cabinet, open the cabinet door, move the bowl above and inside it, and carefully place the bowl into the cabinet. The robot relies on visual cues and prehension to ensure a secure grasp and successful placement. Robust perception and manipulation are required to handle occlusions, proper alignment, and object transitions.",

      "Bowl is located on the counter, accessible and not occluded",
