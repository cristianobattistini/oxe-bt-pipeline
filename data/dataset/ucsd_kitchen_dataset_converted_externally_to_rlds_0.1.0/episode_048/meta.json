  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, a fixed robot arm is tasked with perceiving, approaching, grasping, and transferring a green box into the sink area on a kitchen mock-up. The scene includes a work surface, several distinct objects (green box, sink, other items), and clear visual cues for object and goal locations. The robot must use reliable perception and manipulation skills, with built-in recovery for failed detection/grasp. Physical constraints include gentle contact, alignment to the sink, and low-force placing. The tree explicitly sequences perception, grasp, transfer, and release behaviors while monitoring for failures.",
