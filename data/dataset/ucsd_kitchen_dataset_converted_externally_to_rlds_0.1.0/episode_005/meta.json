  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a robotic arm operating in a kitchen environment, with the objective to open an oven door visible in the bottom compartment. The robot must visually locate the oven door, approach, plan and execute a pulling grasp on its handle, and pull it open. The sequence requires robust perception, alignment, controlled manipulation, and verification. Constraints involve proper perception in clutter, tolerance of possible partial occlusion, and safe interaction with the articulated door.",

      "Oven door is initially closed",
