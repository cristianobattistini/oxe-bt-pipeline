  "task_summary": "The robot is instructed to open the oven door, which requires perception, approach, grasp, pulling the handle, and verifying that the door is open. The behavior tree orchestrates these steps using visual and physical cues evident in the frames.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode depicts a robot manipulating a play-kitchen oven setup. The oven door is initially closed, and the robot must locate the door, position itself properly, grasp the handle or edge, and execute a controlled pull to open it. Success requires accurate detection, safe approach, stable grasp with minimal force, and physical confirmation of door opening, as evidenced by the displacement and alignment changes through the contact sheet. Safety and reliability are prioritized, avoiding excessive force or failure to detect the door state.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Oven door is closed and accessible.",

      "Oven door is visibly open in the workspace.",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Door not detected: retry detection.",

      "Insufficient displacement: increase pull distance and retry.",
