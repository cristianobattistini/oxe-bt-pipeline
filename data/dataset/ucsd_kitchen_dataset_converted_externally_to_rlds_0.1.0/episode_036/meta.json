  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode focuses on a robot arm interacting with a kitchen oven. The robot is tasked to open the oven door, which is located beneath the counter shelf. The procedure involves perceiving and localizing the oven door, positioning the end effector, planning and executing a grasp using a 'pull' strategy, actuating the opening movement, verifying the door's open state, and retreating safely. The robot relies on visual feedback and action primitives constrained by pre-set timeouts and distances. Object location and pose must be stable; ambient clutter is minimal.",
