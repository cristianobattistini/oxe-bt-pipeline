  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The episode showcases a robot arm tasked to open the lower cabinet door in a kitchen scene. Visible: a white cabinet, black handle, and closed door initially. The robot begins by locating the cabinet door, approaches and aligns with it, computes a grasp pose on the handle, grasps, pulls the door open, verifies success, and finally retreats. Phased transitions are visible, progressing from perception to actuation and verification. Robust perception and precise manipulation are required.",
