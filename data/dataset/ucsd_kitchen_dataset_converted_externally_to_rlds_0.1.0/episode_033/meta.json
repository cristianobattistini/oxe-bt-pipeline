    "overview": "This episode involves a robot arm in a kitchen scene performing the task of opening the oven door. The robot first detects the oven door, approaches above it, calculates a side grasp pose, executes the grasp, verifies the hold, then actuates the opening using the 'OpenContainer' primitive. After opening, the robot retreats. Constraints include physical access to the door handle, robust perception, and stable grasping.",
