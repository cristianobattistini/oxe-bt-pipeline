  "task_summary": "The robot is instructed to put a bowl inside the kitchen cabinet. It locates, grasps, transports, and inserts the bowl within the cabinet using sequential perception, motion planning, grasping, and container manipulation.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a robot arm in a toy kitchen setup. Its goal is to find a bowl, grasp it from the counter, and place it inside the designated kitchen cabinet. Using visual perception and manipulation, the robot overcomes occlusions and checks cabinet openness, actively opening it if needed. Sequential steps include object localization, grasp computation, delicate insertion, and retreat, ensuring stable transfer and safe stowage. Frames detail each phase as the robot progresses.",

      "Bowl is present and visible on the counter",
