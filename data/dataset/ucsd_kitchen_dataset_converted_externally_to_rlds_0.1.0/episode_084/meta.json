    "overview": "A robot is instructed to open the door of a kitchen cabinet. The environment includes an upper cabinet, counter, sink, and robot arm. The task involves visually locating the cabinet door, aligning to grasp or push/pull, applying actuation to open the door, verifying it is open, and retreating. Physical constraints include limited workspace and precise maneuvering around the cabinet and counter surfaces.",
