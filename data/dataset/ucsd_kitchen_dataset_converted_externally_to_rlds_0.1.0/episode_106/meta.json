  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This scenario depicts a robotic manipulator operating in a kitchen-like environment. The main object is the oven door, which the robot must open by first locating it visually, approaching and aligning with it, computing a grasp suitable for pulling, executing the grasp, and then pulling until the door is open. The robot finally verifies success by confirming the oven door is indeed open, and retreats safely. Physical alignment, perception, and gentle actuation are essential for safe manipulation.",
