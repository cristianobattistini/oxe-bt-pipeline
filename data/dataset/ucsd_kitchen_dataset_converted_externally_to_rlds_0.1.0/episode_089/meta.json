    "overview": "In a kitchen scene, a robot arm interacts with an oven. The arm must locate, approach, grasp the oven door handle, and pull to open the door. The sequence requires precise perception, controlled force, and confirmation that the door is open before releasing and retreating. Constraints include safe force application and completion within reasonable time, as visually reflected by the arm’s progressive movement and oven state in the contact sheet.",
