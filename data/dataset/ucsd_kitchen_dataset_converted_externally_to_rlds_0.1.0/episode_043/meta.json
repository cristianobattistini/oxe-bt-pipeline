    "overview": "This episode showcases a robotic manipulator in a kitchen, tasked with picking up a teapot and placing it onto the stove. The robot must perceive the teapot, approach it safely, execute a stable grasp, and transfer the teapot over the stove's surface, completing the task with precise placement and appropriate retreat. Visual perception and contact-based feedback help manage object localization and manipulation. The process emphasizes safe handling, object stability, and spatial constraints within a visually cluttered kitchen.",
