    "overview": "The episode features a manipulator tasked to find, approach, and pick up a single red object (cylinder) resting on a black table. The robot sequentially detects the object, aligns above it, lowers until contact is made, and grasps it. Primary constraints include secure acquisition after verifying the object's pose. Scene contains distractors (blue squares) for context.",
