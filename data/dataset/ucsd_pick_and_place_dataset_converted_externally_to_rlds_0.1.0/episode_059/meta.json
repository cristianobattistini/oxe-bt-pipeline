  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The episode shows a stationary robot arm tasked to pick up a small red cylindrical object positioned on a table, surrounded by blue markers. The robot first perceives and locates the red object, sequentially approaches it, opens its gripper, and aligns above the object. It then grasps the object by closing the gripper, verifies grasp success, and lifts the object from the table. The task concludes with the robot retreating after the pickup. The environment is uncluttered except for blue tape markers used for calibration or reference. The instruction and visual evidence fully align: no place or transfer occurs, only pickup.",
