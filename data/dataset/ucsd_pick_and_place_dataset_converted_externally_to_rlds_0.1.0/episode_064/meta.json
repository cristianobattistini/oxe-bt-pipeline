  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a robot arm tasked with picking up a red cuboid object from a table. The robot must first detect and confirm the location of the red object among several distractors (blue ball, purple dodecahedron), safely approach it from above, align the end effector, open the gripper, lower to contact, close the gripper, and verify grasp stability. All operations are sequential, and perception gates execution. Environmental conditions like lighting and object pose may challenge perception. Recovery steps are available for initial visual failure.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot arm is powered on, homed, and ready.",
      "Red object is present on table surface.",
      "No obstructions between gripper and red object."

      "Approach and align with positional tolerance (5mm).",
      "Open gripper to 6cm width.",
      "Lower until slow contact is detected (max depth 5cm, force threshold 5N).",
      "Close gripper with 10N force.",
      "Verify grasp stability and red object in gripper."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Red object lifted off table surface.",
      "Object stably held by gripper (no slip).",
      "No other objects disturbed."

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Failure to perceive red object: retry scan up to 3 times.",
