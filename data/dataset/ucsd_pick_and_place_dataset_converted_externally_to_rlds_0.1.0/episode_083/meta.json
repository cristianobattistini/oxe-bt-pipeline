  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, a robotic manipulator interacts with a kitchen scene that includes a pot on the countertop, a sink, and supporting cabinetry. The robot must visually locate the pot, approach it from a suitable angle, compute and perform a reliable grasp, confirm its grip, then transfer the pot to the sink and release it onto the sink’s surface. Throughout, visual verification and correct placement are crucial to prevent task failure due to misalignment or object slip.",
