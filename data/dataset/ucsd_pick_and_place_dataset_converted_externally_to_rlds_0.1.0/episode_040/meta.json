    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation task using a robotic manipulator in a static environment. The robot must locate the red block (identified on the table), approach it, grasp it securely from the top, and lift it up from the table. Steps follow the sequential order visible in the 9 contact-sheet frames. No placement or transfer is required, just picking up the object.",
