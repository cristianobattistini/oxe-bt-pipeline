    "overview": "A robot arm is instructed to locate and pick up a small red block from a planar table surface. The scene shows the red block and blue markers for reference. The arm starts above the table, approaches the block, opens the gripper, lowers, grasps, and lifts. Constraints: reliable visual detection, gentle grasp, and sufficient lift to clear the block off the table.",
