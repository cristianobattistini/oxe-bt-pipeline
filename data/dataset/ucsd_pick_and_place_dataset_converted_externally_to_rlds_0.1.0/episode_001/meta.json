  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a fixed-base robotic arm manipulating objects on a tabletop. The scene contains a red cylindrical object (the target) and blue blocks as distractors. Across nine sequential frames, the robot perceives the environment, approaches the red cylinder, aligns and opens its gripper, grasps the object using a top-down strategy, and then retreats, lifting the object. The plan is informed by both the instruction and visual evidence, ensuring each behavioral phase is mapped directly to the observed states in the episode.",
