    "overview": "The scene shows a robot arm and a tabletop with a red cylindrical object and a blue tray. The robot's goal is to pick up the red object from the table. The task progresses through perception, approach, grasp, and lifting phases using visual and force feedback to ensure reliable execution with moderate precision. The system adapts if the red object is not immediately visible by rescanning before proceeding to manipulation steps.",
