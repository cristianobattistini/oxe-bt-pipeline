    "overview": "This episode demonstrates a robotic arm executing a sequential pick operation on a red cylindrical object placed on a black table with marked blue tape areas. The robot must perceive, precisely approach, grasp, lift, and retreat from the object. Adherence to safe grasp forces and motion timing is crucial to ensure reliability without collision.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Red object is present on the table within reach.",

      "Compute a top-down grasp pose.",
      "Approach and align to the object with tight tolerance.",
      "Lower gripper until contact is sensed.",
      "Close gripper gently to grasp the object.",
      "Verify stable grasp and confirm object in gripper.",
      "Lift the object vertically.",
      "Retreat from its original position."
