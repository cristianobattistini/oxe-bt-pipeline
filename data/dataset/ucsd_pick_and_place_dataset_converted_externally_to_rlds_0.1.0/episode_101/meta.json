  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a robot arm tasked with reliably picking up a single red block positioned on a flat table. The workspace is visually segmented with blue markers, indicating a pose calibration setup. The sequence begins with object recognition, continues through precise approach and alignment, executes a top grasp, and is completed by lifting the object from the table. Constraints include robust perception and ensuring a stable grasp. The blue region is not interacted with; only the red block is targeted.",
