    "overview": "A robot arm is instructed to locate and pick up a red block from a table. The environment is marked with blue tape for reference. The key role of the robot is to execute perception, approach, grasp planning, and manipulation to securely pick the red block. The robot uses visual feedback to find the target if it is not immediately visible, opens its gripper, approaches above the block, computes a grasp pose, and actuates the gripper to pick the block. Environment is static except for the red block.",
