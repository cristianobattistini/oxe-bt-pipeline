    "overview": "This task involves a robot arm performing perception, approach, grasp, transfer, and placement of a pot into a sink located on a miniature kitchen work surface. The robot must correct for object visibility, securely grasp the pot (using a top strategy), and place it inside the bounded area of the sink, guided visually throughout. The environment contains a pot (blue) initially on the countertop, a stainless steel sink, and some background distractors, but only the pot is manipulated.",
