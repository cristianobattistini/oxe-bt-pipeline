    "overview": "This task involves a robot arm interacting with a kitchen playset. The main goal is to locate the pot seen on the counter/stovetop, grasp it securely, and transfer it into the adjacent sink area. The tree ensures the pot is detected before grasping and rechecks sink visibility before placement. Mechanical constraints are respected, with place press force and location snapped to legal bins. Visual cues confirm each phase in the nine frames.",
