  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a robot arm interacting with a tabletop workspace. The primary objects are a red cylinder and several blue objects, all resting on a black table. The robot visually locates the red cylinder, approaches above, gently lowers until contact, grasps, verifies capture, and then retreats, completing the pick-up step. The task emphasizes reliable object detection, precise alignment, and a stable grasp while minimizing table contact force.",

      "Robot arm is powered and calibrated",
