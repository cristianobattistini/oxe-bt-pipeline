  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a fixed-base robot positioned next to a miniature kitchen set. The objective is to move a pot from its resting place on the countertop and deposit it into the sink basin. The robot must perceive, localize, and stabilize its grasp on the pot, then transport and precisely place the pot in the sink. Environmental constraints include clear object visibility and unobstructed pathways, with motion planned to avoid collisions with sink or cabinet fixtures.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot is placed on the counter, visibly within reach.",
      "Sink basin is empty and accessible.",
      "No obstructing objects between robot and target locations.",
      "Gripper is open and ready."

      "Scan for pot; confirm visibility.",
      "Open gripper and move above the pot.",

      "Move above sink; place pot on sink surface.",
      "Open gripper to release pot.",
      "Retreat arm for task completion."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Pot stably resides inside sink after release.",
