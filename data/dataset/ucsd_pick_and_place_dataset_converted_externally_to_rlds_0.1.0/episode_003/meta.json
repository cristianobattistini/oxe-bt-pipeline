    "overview": "This episode involves a robotic arm observing a workspace with several objects placed on a black table. The main target is the red object (a cylinder) positioned centrally among several blue objects. The robot must perceive, locate, and pick up the red object via a standard top grasp, using visual feedback and tactile contact. The gripper opens prior to grasping, lowered until gentle contact is made, and closes with moderate force, verifying stability before confirming success. The scene is static, with no dynamic obstacles.",
