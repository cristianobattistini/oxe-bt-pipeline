  "task_summary": "Robot arm is tasked to pick up the red object from the table. The sequence includes perceiving, approaching, grasping, verifying grasp, and lifting the object.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a robotic manipulator picking up a red, cylindrical object from a table surface marked with several blue squares, as shown in frames [0]-[8]. The robot moves from perception to approach, aligns above the object, lowers to make contact, closes the gripper to grasp, verifies the grasp is stable, and lifts the object above the table. The table and red object are the only objects involved; precise alignment and gentle grasping are implied. The robot uses visual and contact feedback for reliability.",
