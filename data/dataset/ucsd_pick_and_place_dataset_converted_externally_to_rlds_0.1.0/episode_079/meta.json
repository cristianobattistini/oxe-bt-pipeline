    "overview": "The robot must locate a red block placed on a black table, approach it using its gripper, and pick it up. The environment contains additional blue objects which are not the target, and the task requires accurate perception and stable grasping. The behavior is grounded in sequential visual phases from detection through grasp and lifting, with retry logic for perception if required.",
