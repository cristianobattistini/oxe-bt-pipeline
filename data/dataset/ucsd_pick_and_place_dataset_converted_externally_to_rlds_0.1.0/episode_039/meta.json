  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a robot arm assigned to locate, approach, and pick up a small red cylinder placed on a black table. Blue tape markers are present nearby for calibration or referencing. The arm uses onboard vision to detect the target object, moves above it, aligns precisely, and grasps using a parallel-jaw gripper. Once grasped, it lifts the object gently off the tabletop, pausing briefly to confirm success.",

      "Object not visible: Retry visual search (up to 3 times)",

    "termination": "Task ends successfully when the red object is lifted and held stably above the table, or on failure after retries are exhausted."
