  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, a robotic arm is tasked with picking up a red, vertically-oriented cylindrical object placed on a flat black table, surrounded by blue markers. The robot utilizes visual detection, alignment, and gentle grasping steps to reliably acquire the red object. The focus is on robust perception under possible occlusion, secure but non-destructive grasp, and vertical transfer off the table, as indicated by chronologically ordered frame evidence. No explicit placement occurs after pickup.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Red cylindrical object present on the table.",
      "Robot arm and gripper initialized and unobstructed.",

      "Approach and align with the object within tight tolerance.",
      "Close the gripper with moderate force to grasp.",
      "Verify object is retained in gripper.",
      "Raise the held object vertically to clear the table."

    "success_criteria": [
      "Red object is firmly held by the gripper.",

      "Perception fails: re-scan up to 3 times.",
