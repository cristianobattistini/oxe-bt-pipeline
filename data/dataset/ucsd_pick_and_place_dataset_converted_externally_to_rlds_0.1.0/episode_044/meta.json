    "overview": "A robotic manipulator in a compact kitchen workspace must move a pot from a location in front of the sink onto and into the sink. The workspace contains a stovetop, sink, and the pot is initially placed on the counter. The robot must visually locate the pot, approach, grasp, move to the sink area, and place the pot there with an appropriate release. Observed constraints: workspace tightness, direct placement.",
