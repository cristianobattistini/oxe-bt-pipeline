    "overview": "A robotic manipulator executes the task of picking up a red cylindrical object from a table, as captured in 9 sequential frames. The environment features a black tabletop, blue markers for spatial referencing, and the robot utilizes detection and approach routines. The BT ensures robust perception, safe approach, minimal-grip force, and verifies object capture before lift and retreat. No placement is performed, only lifting from table.",

      "Red object is present and accessible on the table.",
