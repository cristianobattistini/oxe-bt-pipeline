  "task_summary": "The robot is tasked to pick up a red block from the table using its gripper. The sequence covers perception, approach, grasp planning, grasp execution, and verification.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a robot equipped with a parallel-jaw gripper positioned over a workspace containing a red block and other blue objects. The robot must locate the red block on the table, move to a pre-grasp pose above it, align for grasping, open the gripper, compute an appropriate grasp, execute the grasp, and verify that the block is securely held. The design is derived strictly from the visual progression in frames and the explicit instruction.",

      "Red block is present and visible on the table",
