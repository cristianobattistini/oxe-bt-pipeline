  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The robot arm is configured to locate, approach, and grasp a red block present on a black table surface. Visual feedback guides perception and alignment. The scene includes other colored blocks but the focus is the red block. The robot must open its gripper, move above and close in on the block with a reliably gentle force, grasp it, confirm acquisition, and then retreat to signal completion. Actions follow a standard pick-up routine, retrying visual acquisition up to three times if needed.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Red block is present and fully visible on the table.",
      "Gripper is initially open and free of objects.",
      "Robot arm is able to reach and has unobstructed access."

      "Approach and align with tight tolerance.",
      "Close the gripper with moderate force.",
      "Confirm the object is held.",
      "Retreat slightly post-grasp."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Red block is securely held in the gripper after the sequence.",
      "No collisions or dropped objects.",
      "Gripper closes and object detaches cleanly from table."

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Block not found: perform up to 3 scan retries.",
      "Grasp fails: signal acquisition failure, robot remains in safe pose.",
      "Visual feedback ambiguous: abort and notify."
