    "overview": "The robot arm is tasked to pick up a red block from a black-surfaced table. The block is placed among blue markers indicating workspace boundaries or keypoints. The sequence involves locating the red block, positioning the gripper, approaching from above, closing the gripper to secure, and raising the block cleanly above the table. The environment is uncluttered except for several blue squares, and the scene is static throughout.",
