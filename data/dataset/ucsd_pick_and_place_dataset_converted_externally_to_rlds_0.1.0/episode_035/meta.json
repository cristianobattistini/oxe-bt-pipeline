    "overview": "This episode shows a stationary robot arm performing a pick action on a task table. The main object is a red, cylindrical block placed on the table surface, distinguishable from nearby blue objects and marking tape. The robot must locate, approach, grasp, and raise this red object, handling transient failures in perception or grasp. All movements must be sequential and precise, focusing on the red object only.",
