    "overview": "This task requires a robot arm to locate a pot on the kitchen surface, pick it up using an overhead grasp, and place it into the sink on the right side of the workspace. The robot must detect both the pot and the sink using visual sensors, plan and execute the grasp, transfer the pot while avoiding obstacles, and release it safely. Constraints include precise perception of both objects and controlled manipulation to prevent collisions or spillage.",

      "Pot is present and visually accessible on the workspace.",
