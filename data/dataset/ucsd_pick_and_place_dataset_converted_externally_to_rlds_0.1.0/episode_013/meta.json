    "overview": "This episode features a tabletop scene with a robot arm, a pot initially on the countertop, and an empty sink. The robot is tasked to detect and pick up the pot, transfer it, and accurately place it in the sink. Robust object perception (pot and sink), safe grasping, and careful placement are essential. Scene objects include the robotic arm, the pot, the sink, and surrounding countertop clutter, demanding precise spatial reasoning and recovery from perception or manipulation failures.",
