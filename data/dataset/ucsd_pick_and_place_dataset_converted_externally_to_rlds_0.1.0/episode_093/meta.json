    "overview": "A robot manipulator is tasked with picking up a red cylindrical object resting on a flat table marked by blue tape. The robot must perceive, approach, and grasp the red object without disturbing the surrounding area, using a top-down strategy for manipulation. The sequence covers perception, approach, alignment, grasp, verification, and lift phases for robust pick-up.",
