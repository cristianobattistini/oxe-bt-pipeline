  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this task, a robot arm locates a red cylindrical object placed on a table (marked with blue tape as reference zones). The arm approaches, aligns, and grasps the object using its end-effector, monitoring contact and grasp stability. The visual sequence suggests a methodical transition from perception to grasp, without subsequent transfer or placement. The process emphasizes careful acquisition, using contact-sensing and visual verification, and employs recovery on perception failure. All actions correspond closely to the instruction and observed scene, which contains only one manipulable item (red cylinder) and no evidence of placing.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Red cylindrical object is present and detectable on the table.",

      "Approach and align with tight tolerance.",
      "Open gripper to pre-grasp width.",
      "Lower slowly until contact is sensed at defined force threshold.",
