    "overview": "The robot arm is commanded to locate, approach, and pick up a red block from a tabletop scene with various blue tiles. The system must first perceive and visually confirm the red object, open its gripper, accurately approach the red block from above, grasp it with appropriate force, and confirm a successful pickup. There are no explicit placement steps observed or instructed, and the environment appears uncluttered except for the block and tiles.",
