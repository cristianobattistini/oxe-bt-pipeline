  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a tabletop pick task, where a robotic arm must find and pick up a red cylindrical object positioned on a black table alongside blue markers. The robot visually detects the object, aligns from above, lowers gently until contact, grasps, verifies the grip, and slightly lifts the object. Constraints include gentle force, precise alignment, and robust object detection. The task emphasizes perception and compliant grasping.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Red cylindrical object is placed on the table within reachable workspace.",
      "Robot is initialized and gripper is open.",
      "Vision system is operational.",
      "Workspace is clear of obstructions."

      "Approach and align with the object.",
      "Lower slowly until contact is detected.",
      "Close the gripper with moderate force.",
      "Verify a stable grasp.",
      "Lift/retract slightly from the table."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Red object is securely held by the gripper.",
      "No object slippage detected after lift.",
      "No damage or displacement of unintended objects."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If object not visible, retry scan procedure up to three attempts.",
      "If grasp is unstable, restart from open gripper and realignment.",
      "If contact is not detected within lowering phase, abort and report."
