  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode shows a robotic arm tasked with picking up a red cylinder positioned on a table, surrounded by blue objects. The robot follows a perception–approach–grasp–lift sequence, managing visual checks, approach alignment, gentle grasping, and then lifting the object vertically. The BT includes strategies for retrying detection if the red object is not immediately visible, with tuned timeouts and grasping force reflecting a gentle pick-up. There are no explicit placement or transfer actions in this episode.",
