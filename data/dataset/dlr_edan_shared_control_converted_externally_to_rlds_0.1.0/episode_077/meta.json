    "overview": "A stationary manipulator interacts with two objects—a die and a disk—placed atop a shelf. The robot's goal is to pick up the die, which requires perception to locate the die, approaching from above, aligning precisely, computing a grasp, and executing the grasp. The sequence is robust to minor occlusions and distractions from the other object (disk). All actions occur using a parallel gripper, with pre-programmed sequences to standardize grasp approach and retreat.",
    "preconditions": [
      "The die is present on the shelf and visible or detectable.",
