    "overview": "This episode centers around a robot arm performing a pick action on a cube that is located inside a shelf unit. The robot must first find the cube, then approach and align itself, compute a suitable grasp pose, actuate the gripper to grasp, and verify grasp stability. The environment is an open area with a black shelf and the cube in a lower compartment. The robot proceeds in a structured manner with no explicit recovery movements.",
