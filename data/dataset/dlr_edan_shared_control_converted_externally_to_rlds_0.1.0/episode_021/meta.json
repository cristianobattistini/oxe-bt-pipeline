    "overview": "The robot arm is tasked with picking up a yellow ball placed on a small table. The environment contains distractor objects such as two white blocks and a vase. The robot perceives the ball, approaches and aligns to it, grasps gently, and then executes a retreat motion with the object. The task requires secure object detection, a stable grasp, and basic collision avoidance.",
