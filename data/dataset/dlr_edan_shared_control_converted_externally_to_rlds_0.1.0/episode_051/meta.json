  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The robot uses its arm to approach, localize, and pick up a small white cube positioned on the upper-right shelf of a dark-colored cabinet within an indoor environment. The process includes visual search/verification, precise end-effector positioning above the cube, gripper opening, pose computation, and executing a grasp. The robot uses automatic verification to ensure object acquisition. Safety and efficiency are considered, with repeated perception attempts allowed in case of occlusion or miss.",
