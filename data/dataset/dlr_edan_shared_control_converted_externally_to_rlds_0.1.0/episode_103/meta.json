    "overview": "This episode involves a robotic arm operating in a kitchen-like environment to pick up a white die placed on the top of a cubby shelf. The robot must reliably perceive the die, approach it from above, align the end effector for a top grasp, and securely grasp the die. The sequence is performed in discrete phases as seen in the contact sheet frames.",
