  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a blue kinesthetic robot arm operating in a tabletop scenario with three objects: an orange, an apple, and a white cube. The environment includes a table, shelf, and background objects. The robot must visually detect the orange, approach from above, align, and grasp it securely, then lift it. The scene is unoccluded, well-lit, and uncluttered, allowing straightforward execution with perception and manipulation primitives. No significant obstacles are present. Grasp stability is briefly verified post-grasp.",
