  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode depicts a robot arm tasked with picking up a tube placed on a shelf. The workspace includes a black shelving unit, a white tube to be picked, a second white object, and a flower vase. The robot must visually locate the tube, approach from above, align, open the gripper, compute a suitable top grasp, execute the grasp, and verify it has securely picked up the tube. No placement is required; task ends on successful pick. Scene lighting and occlusion are moderate, and additional obstacles (second object, vase) are not direct targets.",
