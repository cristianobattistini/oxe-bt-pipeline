  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The task requires a robotic arm to locate, approach, and grasp a cube placed on a shelving unit. The robot must perceive the cube, open its gripper, move above the target, compute and execute an appropriate grasp, and confirm that the cube is held securely. The environment is a kitchen-like setting with bright lighting and an uncluttered workspace, minimizing perception errors. The main role is for the robot to complete a reliable pick with minimal force for safe manipulation.",
