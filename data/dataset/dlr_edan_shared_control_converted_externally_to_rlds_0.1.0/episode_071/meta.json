  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The episode depicts a robot arm in a home or laboratory setting tasked to pick up a tube-shaped object from a shelf. The robot navigates visually and physically to access, align, and securely grasp the tube. The black shelf contains the tube and other distractor objects, with an artificial flower on top. The robot follows an orderly perception and manipulation procedure, using visual detection and spatial alignment to initiate grasp. The process adheres to basic constraints: targeting only the tube as specified, maintaining safe gripper opening before approach, and confirming grasp success.",
