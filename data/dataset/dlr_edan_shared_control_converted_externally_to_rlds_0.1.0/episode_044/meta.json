    "overview": "This task requires a robotic arm to pick up a white cube located within the lower right cell of a shelf. The robot must first perceive and localize the cube, open the gripper, approach and align above the object, compute and execute a top grasp, verify the object is secured, and finally retreat after grasping. The scene is in a kitchen, and the cube is the only object targeted for manipulation.",
