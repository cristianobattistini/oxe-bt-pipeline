    "overview": "A blue robotic arm attempts to pick up a disk-shaped object from a cubby shelf in a modern kitchen setting. The sequence involves perception, approach, alignment, grasp, and post-grasp verification. The robot operates from a left-approach angle, with no apparent obstructions. The gripper opens before approaching the target disk. Scene context cues suggest this is a simple tabletop pick with moderate constraints on time and precision.",
