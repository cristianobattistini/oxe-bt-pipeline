    "overview": "A blue robotic arm is tasked to pick a small white cylindrical tube from a black shelving unit in a kitchen-like environment. The sequence begins with perception, proceeds through gripper opening and alignment, then gripping and lifting of the tube. There is only one target object ('tube') to be handled, which sits beside a larger white cup. The task demands precise manipulation and stable grasp.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot arm is operational and within workspace reach.",
      "The tube is present and unobstructed on the shelf.",
