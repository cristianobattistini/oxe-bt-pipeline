    "overview": "A blue 7-DOF robot arm in a kitchen-like space interacts with a small white tube resting on a shelf. The arm first visually locates the tube, then prepares its gripper, approaches and aligns above the tube, computes a grasp pose, executes the grasp, verifies the object is held, and retreats with the tube. Key constraints: avoid colliding with shelf or other objects. The robot must react to failures in perception or grasp.",
