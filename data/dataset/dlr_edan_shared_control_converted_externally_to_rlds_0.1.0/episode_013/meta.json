    "overview": "A robot arm in a shared kitchen/lab environment is tasked to pick a disk object placed inside a bottom shelf cubby. The shelves also hold a white cube and a flower pot; the robot must avoid damaging surroundings. Perception ensures visibility/pose of the disk, followed by sequential approach, alignment, top-down grasp planning, and execution. Task completion is verified by confirming the disk is securely in the gripper.",

      "Disk located in lower right cubby of shelving unit.",
