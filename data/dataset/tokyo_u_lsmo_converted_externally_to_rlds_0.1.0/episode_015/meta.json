    "overview": "This scenario features a desktop environment where a robot arm is required to reach a blue pen located behind obstructing books. The robot must first perceive both the pen and obstacles, plan a collision-free route, move towards an intermediate safe waypoint, and then approach the pen. Throughout, robust perception and navigation ensure avoidance and precise localization, with verification at the end.",
