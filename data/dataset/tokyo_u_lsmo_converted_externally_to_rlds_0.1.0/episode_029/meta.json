  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a tabletop manipulator in an office environment, which must visually locate a pair of scissors, plan a collision-free approach avoiding objects (e.g., mugs, books) obstructing the direct path, and navigate to a pre-grasp or approach pose above the scissors. Primary constraints are avoidance of all visible obstacles and precise final alignment with the scissors.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is powered and homed",
      "Sensors are online",

      "Approach and align while checking for obstacles",
      "Move along Y axis to fine-tune approach/avoid obstacle",
      "Verify arrival at the scissors"

    "success_criteria": [
      "Robot is aligned with and at specified pose above the scissors",

      "Obstacle in path: adjust approach using MoveDelta",
      "Vision misalignment: fallback to scanning or local realignment"

    "termination": "Task terminates when the robot is confirmed to be at the scissors location, above or beside it, with all obstacles avoided."
