    "overview": "A robot arm must identify the position of scissors on a cluttered tabletop while avoiding a prominent obstacle, then move to a position above the scissors, align, and make a final approach. The sequence involves perception to localize the scissors, navigation/planning to avoid collisions with objects blocking direct paths, and progressive motion refinement near the goal.",
