  "task_summary": "The robot must reach the scissors while avoiding or pushing aside an obstacle blocking the path. Moment-by-moment visual evidence directs the plan to first perceive the scissors, align, actuate to move the obstacle, and finally approach the scissors.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode takes place in an office-like environment with a white robotic arm, a visible obstacle (books), and a pair of scissors as the goal object. The robot must efficiently locate the scissors, plan approach paths around or by clearing the obstacle via pushing, and finally navigate to the scissors. Key constraints are collision avoidance and robust perception in clutter.",
