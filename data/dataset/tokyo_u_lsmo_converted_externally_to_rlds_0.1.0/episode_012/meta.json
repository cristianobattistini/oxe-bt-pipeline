  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This scene takes place in a lab with a robot arm on a tabletop surrounded by books, a small block, a cup, and a pair of scissors. The robot’s goal is to reach the scissors, located in a cluttered environment, and avoid colliding with a nearby obstacle (block). It uses visual perception to locate the scissors, checks for obstacle presence, shifts position to bypass the obstacle, and then approaches the scissors for a final alignment.",
