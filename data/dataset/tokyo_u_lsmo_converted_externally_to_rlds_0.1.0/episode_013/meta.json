  "task_summary": "The robot must reach the scissors by navigating around a visible obstacle, using perception and waypoint maneuvering to avoid collisions.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a robotic arm operating in a tabletop environment with multiple objects, notably a pair of scissors placed on the table. The robot starts at rest, identifies and localizes the scissors, then plans a trajectory to reach them while avoiding an adjacent obstacle, likely represented by a mug or container. The role of the robot is perception-driven manipulation, constrained by obstacle avoidance and target approach accuracy.",
