  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop robot arm identifies the position of a pair of scissors among other objects, then moves toward it while avoiding obstruction by carefully navigating and aligning above the scissors. The robot's sequence leverages perception, approach, obstacle avoidance, and retreat motions. The central role is to prove robust navigation and approach capability in a cluttered tabletop scene with the scissors as the explicit goal.",

      "Scissors are properly located.",
      "Robot moves above the scissors without collision.",

      "Failure: Scissors not visible—retry scan (up to 3 attempts).",
      "Failure: No approach path—abort motion, report.",
      "Failure: Obstacle blocks path—abort or adjust lateral move."
