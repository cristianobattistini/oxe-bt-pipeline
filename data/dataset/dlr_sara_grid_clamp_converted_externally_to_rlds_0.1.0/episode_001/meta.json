  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed UR-type manipulator with a parallel gripper starts already holding a small grid clamp above a workboard with stacks of clamps and a metal plate area used as the placement site. The goal is to approach the plate, align precisely, descend until gentle contact, place the clamp, release it, and then retreat to a safe height. Movements should be deliberate with tight in-plane alignment and low contact force during touchdown to avoid toppling nearby stacks.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot has the grid_clamp firmly grasped",
      "Plate area on table is clear enough for placement",

      "Open gripper to release",
      "Retreat vertically to a safe distance",

    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Clamp rests flat on the plate without sliding",
      "No collision with nearby stacks or fixtures",
      "Gripper fully opens and is empty after release",
      "End-effector retreats to safe clearance"

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If alignment fails, re-approach and realign",
      "If contact not detected within depth, abort and retry from above",
      "If object slips, stop and regrasp before placing",
      "If obstruction detected, choose an alternate nearby spot on plate"
