  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A robotic arm with a parallel gripper operates over a workbench with linear rails and multiple small clamps. The goal is to place one clamp—assumed to already be in the gripper—onto a designated grid position on the rail. The behavior emphasizes alignment, gentle contact, and precise placement before releasing the clamp and retreating to a safe height. Visual checks and fine approach motions ensure correct pose and minimal disturbance to nearby clamps.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Clamp already secured in gripper",
      "Target grid location visible and reachable",
      "Work surface clear around the goal pose",
      "Robot calibrated; TCP yaw settable"

      "Verify the clamp is in the gripper and the goal area is detected.",
      "Move above the grid target and set TCP yaw for alignment.",
      "Approach and align to the rail/grid features with tight tolerance.",
      "Lower until contact is detected at low force/short depth.",
      "Execute precise placement with tolerance and small press force.",
      "Open gripper to release the clamp.",
      "Retreat vertically to a safe distance and pause briefly."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Clamp sits stably on the rail/grid at the intended pose",
      "No displacement of neighboring clamps",
      "Gripper opens and robot retreats without collisions"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails: re-detect or adjust viewpoint.",
      "If alignment fails: re-run ApproachAndAlign with slightly higher timeout.",
      "If contact not detected within depth: abort and retreat safely, then re-approach.",
      "If clamp sticks after open: micro-raise and re-open, then retry placement."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful release and retreat with the clamp stable at the goal pose."
