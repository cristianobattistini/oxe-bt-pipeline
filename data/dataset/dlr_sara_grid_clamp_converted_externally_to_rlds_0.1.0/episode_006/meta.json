  "task_summary": "The robot, already holding a grid clamp, approaches a precise placement location on the workboard, gently lowers until contact, aligns by yaw, places with light force, releases, and retreats safely. [image:1]",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style collaborative arm with a parallel gripper operates over a wooden work surface with a line of small clamps visible, executing the final placement of a single grid clamp onto a designated spot near a guide rail. The sequence emphasizes approach, fine alignment, controlled vertical contact, compliant placement, release, and clean retreat without disturbing neighboring pieces. [image:1]",
    "preconditions": [
      "Grid clamp is already secured in the gripper at the start of the shown segment. [image:1]",
      "A valid placement pose on the board exists and is referenced as 'place_on_table'. [image:1]",

      "Verify the clamp is in the gripper, move above the target, and set the end-effector yaw to match the lineup. [image:1]",
      "Approach and align in-plane to refine lateral error before descent. [image:1]",
      "Lower slowly until contact, then place to the keyed pose with low press force, open the gripper, and retreat vertically. [image:1]"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Clamp rests stably at the target pose with correct yaw and no displacement of adjacent clamps. [image:1]",
      "Gripper releases fully and the arm clears the area by a safe margin. [image:1]"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If contact is detected early or misalignment occurs, retreat slightly, realign using ApproachAndAlign, and retry the descent. [image:1]",
      "If the clamp slips during release, re-grasp if possible, re-approach, and repeat placement with lower press force. [image:1]"
