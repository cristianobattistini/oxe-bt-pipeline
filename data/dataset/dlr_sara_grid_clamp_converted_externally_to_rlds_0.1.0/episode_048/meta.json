  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base robot arm with a parallel gripper must place a small grid clamp onto a grid/fixture near a SARA-branded block on a tabletop. The contact sheet shows the end-effector already holding the clamp, approaching the fixture, aligning, making gentle contact, releasing, and retreating. The process emphasizes precise lateral alignment and controlled vertical approach to avoid knocking nearby items. Orientation about yaw is adjusted before final descent to match the fixture slots.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Clamp already grasped in the gripper",
      "Workspace clear around grid fixture",
      "Fixture pose observable by the camera/sensor",
      "Robot homed and within reach of the fixture"
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Verify the clamp is in the gripper and move to a safe height above the grid fixture.",
      "Perceive the fixture and refine alignment laterally and in yaw.",
      "Lower slowly until contact is detected and place the clamp onto the fixture.",
      "Open the gripper to release the clamp and retreat to a safe distance."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Clamp rests stably on the target fixture surface",
      "No displacement of nearby items during placement",
      "End-effector retreats without re-contact after release"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If fixture not detected, retry perception up to three attempts and re-approach.",
      "If alignment drifts, repeat the alignment step and adjust yaw.",
      "If contact occurs prematurely, retreat slightly and re-lower slowly."
    ],
    "termination": "Tree terminates after successful release and retreat, or upon unrecoverable failure (e.g., repeated perception failure)."
