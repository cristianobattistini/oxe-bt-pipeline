    "overview": "A fixed robotic arm with a parallel gripper operates at a workbench containing a board with tracks and several small dark clamps. The goal is to locate a single grid clamp, grasp it securely from above, move over the work surface, and place it flat on the board with light press to seat it. The sequence emphasizes perception, alignment, and a clean release with a short retreat to avoid collisions. No long-range navigation is required; all actions are local to the table scene.",
