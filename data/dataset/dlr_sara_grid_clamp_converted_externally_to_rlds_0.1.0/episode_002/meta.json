  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A robotic manipulator equipped with a gripper is tasked to place a grid clamp accurately on a workspace surface. The sequence involves object perception, alignment, controlled placement with minimal press force, and subsequent retreat. The process emphasizes precision, ensuring the clamp aligns correctly with the surface grid while avoiding excessive contact force.",

      "Place grid clamp using a top strategy with limited press force",
      "Release clamp and retract arm"

      "Grid clamp positioned flush within tolerance of 0.01 m",
