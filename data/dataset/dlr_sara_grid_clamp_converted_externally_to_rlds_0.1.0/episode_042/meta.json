  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A robotic arm holds a grid clamp and must place it onto a wooden board with grid/marker lines. The scene shows the SARA setup with a board on the table and several clamps visible. The robot should localize the board, approach from above, align with the grid markings, press lightly to seat the clamp, open the gripper to release, pause briefly, and retreat to a safe height. Precision in alignment and gentle pressing are required to avoid sliding the clamp.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Clamp is already grasped by the gripper",

      "If board not detected: repeat detection or widen search",

      "If clamp shifts during release: re-seat with another light press before retrying release"
