Robustness is excellent, with retries and fallbacks present at all manipulation and navigation steps, ensuring recovery from failures. Compliance is perfect: only PAL v1 primitives (NAVIGATE_TO, GRASP, PLACE_ON_TOP, RELEASE) are used with valid parameters. Patchability is high, as all major actions are modularized into SubTrees with unique node IDs, though a minor improvement could be made by further modularizing the recovery sequence. Overall, the tree is well-structured, robust, compliant, and maintainable.", "used_llm": true}]}
