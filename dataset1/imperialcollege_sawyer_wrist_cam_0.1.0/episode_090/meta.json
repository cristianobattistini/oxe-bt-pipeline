  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode shows a robot tasked with opening a visible lid. The contact sheet frames reveal a white, round object centered against a blue background, which the robot identifies, approaches, manipulates to open, and then retreats from after the lid has been removed. The primary object is the lid; there are no obvious handles, but the robot uses container opening primitives. Task constraints are standard: only one target, robust perception, and positive verification.",
