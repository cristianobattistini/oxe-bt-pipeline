  "task_summary": "Swipe a small white disk-like object across a blue surface using the robot's end effector while maintaining perceptual tracking and alignment.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode demonstrates a robot arm performing a 'swipe' action on a small white disk resting on a blue surface. The robot perceives the object's position, moves its end effector above and in alignment, gently approaches, then swipes (pushes) the disk forward by applying motion along the surface, and finally retreats. The robot leverages visual perception at multiple phases and carefully controls approach, alignment, and force, using low-force sweeping without picking up the object. The scene is focused entirely on object engagement and transfer.",
