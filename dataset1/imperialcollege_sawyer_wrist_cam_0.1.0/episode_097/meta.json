  "task_summary": "A robot arm is tasked with picking up a shoe from a blue surface, using perception, approach, verification, and grasp actions.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The episode centers on a robot arm equipped with a wrist camera attempting to pick up a lone white shoe from a blue background. The robot uses its perception system to detect and localize the shoe, approaches above it, computes a grasp pose (likely from the side given the shoe shape and orientation), and performs a grasp using the gripper. The contact-sheet sequence appears to document the robot's approach, alignment, and closing phases. No evidence of placement is in scope; the goal is solely object acquisition.",
