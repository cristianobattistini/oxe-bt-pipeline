  "task_summary": "The robot opens a lid, as observed in nine sequential close-up frames. The sequence covers perception, approach, alignment, actuation, and post-opening withdrawal.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a robotic arm (Sawyer) manipulating and opening a white circular lid, as seen from a wrist-mounted camera. The task entails locating the lid, approaching it accurately, aligning the end effector, executing a lid opening operation, and retreating from the work area. The scene is visually simple, emphasizing dexterous manipulation with a single large, unobstructed object, likely for manipulation benchmarking or training. Constraints include precise alignment and control of opening actuation.",
