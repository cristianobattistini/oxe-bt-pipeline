  "task_summary": "Pick up a shoe placed on a flat blue surface using a robotic manipulator.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The purpose of this behavior tree is to direct a robot to pick up a single shoe from a blue surface, as observed in the visual frames. The robot must search for and reliably detect the shoe, align above it, open its gripper, compute and move to a suitable grasp pose, perform a top-down grasp, and confirm that the shoe has been picked up. The sequence is robust to minor misdetections and uses visual confirmation and retries where needed.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Shoe is on a blue background within reachable workspace.",
      "Robot gripper is free and operational.",
      "Camera system is functioning and able to perceive the shoe."
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Check if the shoe is already visible.",
      "Scan using a grid pattern up to 3 times if not immediately visible.",
      "Detect the shoe and refine its pose.",
      "Move the gripper above the shoe (offset in z).",
      "Open gripper to 0.06m for grasping.",
      "Compute a top grasp pose and align precisely.",
      "Execute a top-down grasp at the computed pose.",
      "Verify that the shoe is secured in the gripper."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Shoe is firmly held in the gripper post-execution.",
      "No visible collision or dropped object post-grasp.",
      "No failure at any verification stage."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If the shoe is not visible, retry scanning up to 3 times.",
      "If grasp is not successful, task ends; recovery (not in tree) would require higher-level re-planning."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate if the shoe is detected in the gripper or if retries/timeouts are exhausted."
