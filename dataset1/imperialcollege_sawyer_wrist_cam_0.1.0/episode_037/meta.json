  "task_summary": "The robot is tasked with swiping a spherical white ball object across a blue surface using its tool, as visually confirmed in the provided frames.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The episode depicts a robotic arm equipped with a flat tool positioned above a small white ball on a blue surface. The robot first localizes the ball, approaches from above, and aligns. It proceeds to execute a swipe (push) action, propelling the ball with the tool in a specific direction (across the surface). After completing the swipe, the robot retreats its end-effector from the interaction area. No grasping or pick-and-place is performed; only a planar push/swipe.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Ball object is present and visible on the blue surface.",
