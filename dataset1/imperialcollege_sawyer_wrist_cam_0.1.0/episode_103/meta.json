    "overview": "This task involves a robotic arm identifying, grasping, and transferring an apple into a small pot positioned on a blue surface. The apple is bright red and highly visible, and the pot is metallic, open, and stationary. The process prioritizes reliable object detection and gentle manipulation to prevent drops. The visual sequence confirms both grasp and deposit are achievable with direct placement; no lid opening or complex orientation is necessary.",
