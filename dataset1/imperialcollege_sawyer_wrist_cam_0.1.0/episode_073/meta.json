  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This behavior tree coordinates a robot arm equipped with a wrist camera to pick up a bottle from a blue cloth surface. The scene contains a single green plastic bottle, clearly visible and unobstructed in all frames. The robot sequentially detects the bottle, opens its gripper, positions above, computes a top-down grasp, carefully aligns, grasps with low force, and confirms pick-up by checking that the bottle is in the gripper. All visual cues come from the contact sheet, which documents gradual approach and grasp phases, with no transfer or retreat imaged.",
