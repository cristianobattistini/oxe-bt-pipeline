  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a robot operating on a white circular lid situated against a blue background. The robot must perceive and localize the lid, approach it from above, align itself, and then open the lid by actuating a suitable open-lid primitive. The sequence concludes with the robot retreating from the workspace. All actions are sequential and involve perception, alignment, actuation, and retreat. The only manipulandum is the lid; no other relevant objects are visible.",
