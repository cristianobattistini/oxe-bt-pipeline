  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a robot arm with a wrist camera tasked to pick up a white mug from a blue background. The initial scene presents the mug at a distance. The robot must locate, approach, and grasp the mug using visual feedback, attempting retries if the mug is not initially visible. The actions are constrained to a sequential order, ensuring reliable object detection, gripper operation, and grasp verification.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Mug is present on a blue surface within workspace.",
      "Robot arm and gripper are operational.",
      "Camera provides clear visual input of the scene."

      "Check if mug is visible; scan if not.",

      "Approach and align with the mug.",
      "Close gripper with moderate force.",
      "Check if mug is stably in gripper."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Mug is securely grasped and off the surface.",

      "Failure to see mug: Retry scan up to 3 times.",
      "Failure to grasp: Wait for correction or abort.",
      "Perception error: Repeat perception step."
    ],
    "termination": "Tree terminates when mug is confirmed in gripper or upon failure to detect/grasp after retries."
