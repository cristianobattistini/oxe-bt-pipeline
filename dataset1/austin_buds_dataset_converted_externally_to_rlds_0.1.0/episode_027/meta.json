  "task_summary": "Remove the lid from the pot, place the pot onto the plate, then pick up the spatula tool and push the pot toward the front edge of the table.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene shows a small pot with a lid on a stovetop pad, a plate on the left, a spatula tool nearby, and a bowl at the bottom right. The robot must first remove the pot’s lid, then relocate the pot onto the plate, and finally use the spatula as a tool to push the pot toward the table’s front edge. The plan prioritizes reliable perception, stable grasps, gentle placement on the plate, and a deliberate tool-mediated push along the surface.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace clear enough to move between pot, plate, and tool", "Pot and lid are reachable", "Plate is stable on the table surface", "Spatula is accessible for grasping", "No humans within the robot workspace"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect pot, lid, plate, and spatula", "Open/remove the lid using a lid-opening action", "Compute and execute a side grasp on the pot", "Lift and place the pot on the plate, then release", "Compute and grasp the spatula", "Push the pot toward the table front using the spatula", "Put the spatula down and release"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid is no longer on the pot", "Pot is resting centered enough on the plate without toppling", "Final pot position is closer to the table’s front edge than before push", "No collisions with bowl or fixtures"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, rescan targets", "If grasp is unstable, retry with the same or alternate strategy", "If placement misaligns, regrasp and reposition", "If push slips, re-approach and perform a shorter push"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the pot is on the plate and its final position has been shifted toward the table front, with the tool safely released."
