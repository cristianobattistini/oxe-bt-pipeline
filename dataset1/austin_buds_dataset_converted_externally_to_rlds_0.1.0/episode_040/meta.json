  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene shows a robot arm, a pot with a removable lid, a small plate, and a spatula-like tool. The robot must first remove or open the pot, then relocate the pot onto the plate. After placing, the robot employs the spatula to push the pot toward the table’s front (camera-bottom) direction. The behavior tree sequences perception, opening, grasping, placing, and tool-mediated pushing with conservative timeouts and modest forces.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are on the table and visible.",
      "Workspace is clear with no obstacles between end-effector and targets.",
      "Robot gripper and tool-use policies are available."

      "Perceive the plate and place the pot on the plate.",
      "Perceive the spatula and push the pot toward the table’s front.",
      "Retreat to clear the workspace."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is no longer covering the pot.",
      "Pot rests stably on the plate.",
      "Final pot pose is shifted toward the front edge compared to its pre-push pose.",
      "Robot safely retreats without collisions."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If opening fails, retry perception and re-approach before reissuing the open action.",
      "If grasp is unstable, recompute grasp pose and re-grasp.",
      "If placement is off, re-detect plate and re-place.",
      "If push distance is insufficient, issue an additional push."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after a successful push and retreat when all success criteria are satisfied."
