  "task_summary": "Remove the lid from the pot, place the pot on the round plate, then use the spatula to push the pot toward the front edge of the table, and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The scene shows a tabletop with a small pot (initially lidded) on a brown board, a round plate to its left, and a slotted spatula tool on the far left. A manipulator executes three sub-tasks: open the pot by removing its lid, reposition the pot onto the plate, and finally push the pot forward using the spatula. Motions should remain tidy and avoid collisions with nearby fixtures (burner pads) while maintaining visibility of target objects.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot arm is homed and workspace calibrated", "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are within reachable workspace", "No obstacles blocking straight pushes toward table front"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect the pot", "Open the pot by removing the lid", "Detect the plate", "Place the pot on the plate", "Detect the spatula tool", "Push the pot forward using the spatula", "Retreat a short distance and pause"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid is no longer on the pot", "Pot is centered on the plate", "Pot has been pushed toward the table front (downward in the frames)", "Arm ends in a safe, non-contact pose"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If perception fails, rescan targets", "If opening the lid fails, re-approach and retry opening", "If pot slips during placement, re-place on plate", "If push deviates, re-align and push again"],
    "termination": "End after retreat and a brief wait once the pot is on the plate and pushed toward the table front."
