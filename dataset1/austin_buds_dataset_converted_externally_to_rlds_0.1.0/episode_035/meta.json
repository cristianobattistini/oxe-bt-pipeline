  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation task with a small pot and lid, a plate, a spatula-like tool, and other background objects. The robot first ensures the pot is open by removing the lid. It then grasps the pot and relocates it onto the plate. Finally, it grasps the spatula and performs a pushing motion to move the pot toward the table’s front edge. The sequence emphasizes reliable perception, safe grasping, collision-free placement, and controlled pushing with a handheld tool.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot arm initialized and homed",
      "Workspace cleared of unexpected obstacles",
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula visible on the table",

      "Compute and execute a grasp on the spatula tool.",
      "Use the tool to push the pot toward the front of the table.",
      "Retreat to a safe pose."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is no longer covering the pot",
      "Pot rests stably on the plate",
      "Pot is displaced toward the table’s front after the push",
      "No collisions or spills occur"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If lid does not open: retry open after re-detecting pose",
      "If grasp fails: recompute grasp pose and retry",
      "If placement misaligned: pick again and re-place",
      "If push slips or stalls: re-grasp tool and repeat push"
    ],
    "termination": "End when the pot is on the plate and has been pushed toward the table front, followed by a safe retreat."
