  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop arm must manipulate kitchenware. The scene includes a small pot with a lid, a plate, a spatula-like tool, and a bowl on a two-tone surface. The robot first exposes the pot by removing its lid, then grasps the pot and places it on the plate. Finally, it grasps the spatula and performs a pushing motion to slide the pot toward the front edge of the table. Motions should be aligned and gentle to avoid knocking nearby objects.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot has free workspace above the pot and plate", "Spatula is reachable", "Plate is on a stable surface", "Perception detects pot, lid, plate, and spatula"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect pot and lid", "Open (remove) the pot lid", "Approach and align to the pot", "Compute and execute grasp on the pot", "Lift slightly and move", "Place pot on the plate", "Release and retreat", "Grasp the spatula", "Push the pot toward the table front", "Final retreat"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid no longer on the pot", "Pot centered on plate", "Pot’s final position closer to front edge than start", "No collisions or dropped objects"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Grasp slip on pot or tool → retry grasp", "Perception miss → re-detect target", "Push stalls due to friction → increase push distance in a second attempt", "Placement off-center → re-place"],
    "termination": "End when the pot is on the plate and has been pushed toward the table front, with the arm safely retreated."
