  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a small pot with a lid, a cream-colored plate, and a spatula tool. The robot must first remove the lid from the pot. Next, it grasps the pot and places it centered on the plate. Finally, it picks up the spatula and uses it to push the pot toward the front of the table to finish in a reachable, frontmost position. The plan emphasizes reliable perception, safe grasps, and controlled surface interactions with concise timeouts and gentle placement forces.",

    "success_criteria": ["Lid removed from pot", "Pot resting stably on plate", "Pot translated toward the table's front by the commanded distance", "Robot ends in a safe, neutral posture"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If object is not detected, rescan the area", "If grasp is unstable, recompute grasp and retry", "If push stalls, re-approach and repeat with same direction", "If placement contact is detected early, lower gently then open gripper"],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful push and final retreat, or after a non-recoverable perception/manipulation failure."
