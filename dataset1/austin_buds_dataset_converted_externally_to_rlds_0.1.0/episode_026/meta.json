  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The scene shows a tabletop with a small lidded pot, a plate, a spatula-like tool, and a larger pan. The robot must first expose the potâ€™s contents by taking off the lid. Next, it should grasp the pot from the side and place it carefully onto the nearby plate. Finally, it should push the pot forward across the table surface toward the operator-facing edge. The behavior emphasizes basic perception, reliable grasping, precise placement on the plate, and a controlled surface push.",
    "preconditions": ["Pot, lid, plate, and tool are within reachable workspace", "No obstacles occluding approach paths", "Gripper operational and calibrated"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Perceive objects: pot, lid, plate, tool", "Open the lid", "Approach and grasp the pot from the side", "Lift slightly and move to plate pose", "Place pot on plate and release", "Re-approach and push the pot toward the table front", "Retreat and wait"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid is off the pot", "Pot rests stably on the plate", "Pot ends closer to the front edge than initial position without tipping"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If perception fails, re-detect objects", "If grasp unstable, realign and re-grasp", "If placement is misaligned, re-place with tighter tolerance", "If push slips, re-approach and push shorter distance"],
    "termination": "End when the pot is on the plate and has been pushed toward the front, with the robot safely retreated."
