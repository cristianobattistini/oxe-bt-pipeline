  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop robot operates over a small work area with a pot that has a removable lid, a round plate, and a spatula tool. The robot first uncovers the pot by taking off the lid. Next, it grasps the pot and places it centered on the plate. Finally, the robot picks the spatula and uses it to push the pot toward the front edge of the table. The sequence demands reliable perception, stable grasps, gentle placement on the plate, and a controlled pushing motion with a handheld tool.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula visible within reachable workspace",
      "Table surface clear enough to maneuver",
      "Robot gripper functional and calibrated",

      "Detect pot, lid, plate, and spatula.",

      "Compute grasp for the pot, grasp it, lift slightly, and move above the plate.",
      "Place pot on the plate and release.",
      "Compute grasp for spatula, grasp it, move above pot.",
      "Push pot toward the front of the table with the spatula, then release tool and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is off the pot",
      "Pot is resting stably on the plate",
      "Pot is pushed toward the front edge along the table surface",
      "No objects toppled or moved unintentionally"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If lid opening fails: re-approach pot and retry open.",
      "If pot grasp unstable: re-compute grasp and retry pinch strategy.",
      "If placement misaligned: lift and re-place with a second attempt.",
      "If push path obstructed: retreat, adjust approach, and repeat push."
    ],
    "termination": "End when pot sits on the plate and has been pushed in the intended frontward direction; gripper is empty and robot safely retreated."
