  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop kitchen scene shows a pot with a lid on a brown stovetop board, a small plate to the left, a spatula tool, and a large bowl. The robot first removes the pot’s lid and sets it on the table. Next, it grasps the pot and places it squarely on the small plate. Finally, the robot picks up the spatula and uses it to push the pot (now on the plate) toward the near edge of the table. Movements are deliberate and keep clear of nearby clutter.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot has calibrated camera and reachable workspace over table.",
      "Objects present: pot with lid, plate, spatula tool, clear front edge of table.",
      "Gripper functional for top and side grasps."

      "Open gripper, detect and grasp the pot lid from the top.",

      "Release and retreat from the pot.",
      "Detect and grasp the spatula.",
      "Push the pot toward the front edge of the table using the spatula, then retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is removed from pot and rests on the table.",
      "Pot is stably placed on the plate.",
      "Pot is pushed toward the front edge by approximately the commanded distance.",
      "No collisions with bowl, board, or other fixtures."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails, re-detect from a slightly different viewpoint.",
      "If grasp slips, reopen gripper, recompute pose, and retry.",
      "If push deviates, perform another short push with corrected direction."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate when the push completes and the arm safely retreats."
