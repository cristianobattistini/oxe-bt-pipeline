  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A table-top robot works with a pot that initially has a lid, a nearby plate (round coaster), and a spatula-like tool. The robot must first expose the pot’s contents by opening its lid. Next, it relocates the pot onto the plate. Finally, using the spatula as a tool, it pushes the pot toward the front edge of the workspace. The contact sheet shows the pot, plate, and tool positions and the robot’s approach and manipulation around them.",
