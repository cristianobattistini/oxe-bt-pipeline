  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop robot interacts with a pot that initially has a lid, a plate to the right, and a spatula-like tool. The robot must first remove the lid, then grasp and place the pot onto the plate. After placement, the robot should grasp the spatula and push the pot toward the front of the table to bring it closer to the operator. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, stable grasping, gentle placement on the plate, and a controlled push using the tool, following the visual sequence from the frames.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are visible on the table",
      "Workspace is unobstructed along the push direction toward the table's front",
      "Gripper and tool are operational"

      "Perceive all relevant objects: pot, lid, plate, and spatula.",
      "Open the pot by removing its lid and set the lid down on the table.",
      "Compute grasp for the pot, grasp it, lift slightly, and place it centered on the plate; release and retreat.",
      "Compute grasp for the spatula, pick it, verify it's held, then push the pot toward the table front.",
      "Set the tool down and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid removed from pot",
      "Pot resting on the plate without tipping",
      "Pot translated toward the front edge after the push",
      "Robot ends clear of objects"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If perception fails, re-run detection and re-approach.",
      "If grasp is unstable, reopen gripper, recompute grasp, and retry.",
      "If placement is misaligned, lift slightly and re-place on the plate.",
      "If push is ineffective, repeat push with the tool while maintaining contact."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate when the pot is on the plate and visibly closer to the front edge, tool is released, and the arm is in a safe retreat pose."
