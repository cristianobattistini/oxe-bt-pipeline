  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop robot interacts with a pot that initially has a lid, a small plate, and a spatula tool. The robot must open the pot by removing its lid, then grasp and relocate the pot so that it rests on the plate. Finally, the robot should pick up the spatula and push the pot toward the front of the table to bring it closer to the user. Actions must be reliable and gentle enough to avoid tipping or spilling the pot while ensuring accurate placement on the plate.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are within the workspace and visible.",
      "Robot has a functional gripper and can execute pushing with a hand-held tool.",
      "Table surface is clear enough to slide/push the pot safely."
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Detect pot and lid; open the pot by removing the lid.",
      "Detect the plate; compute a top grasp on the pot and grasp it.",
      "Raise the pot and place it centered on the plate; release and retreat.",
      "Detect and grasp the spatula tool.",
      "Push the pot toward the front edge of the table using the spatula; retreat and release the tool."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is removed (container is open).",
      "Pot is stably placed on the plate.",
      "Pot is moved toward the tableâ€™s front by the intended push distance without toppling."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails, retry perception and re-align.",
      "If grasp is unstable, reopen gripper and recompute grasp pose.",
      "If push stalls or deviates, regrasp tool and repeat push with corrected direction."
    ],
    "termination": "End when pot rests on the plate and has been pushed toward the front; robot safely releases the tool and retreats."
