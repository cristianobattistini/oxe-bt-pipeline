  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a pot with a lid, a small round plate, a spatula-like tool, and a bowl on a two-tone surface. The robot must first take the lid off the pot, then relocate the pot onto the plate, and finally use the spatula to push the pot toward the front (operator) edge of the table. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, stable grasps, gentle placement onto the plate, and a planar push with the tool toward a specific direction.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are on the table and reachable.",
      "Robot gripper is functional and empty at start.",
      "Workspace is free of unexpected obstacles near the motion paths."

      "Perceive and grasp the spatula tool.",
      "Push the pot toward the front edge of the table using the spatula.",
      "Release the tool and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is no longer covering the pot.",
      "Pot is resting on the plate with visible contact.",
      "Pot has been pushed toward the front edge as intended."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If grasp is unstable, retry alignment and close gripper again.",
      "If placement misaligns, re-approach and re-place.",
      "If push stalls, re-approach pot with tool and repeat push with same direction."
    ],
    "termination": "End when the push is completed and the robot has released the tool and retreated."
