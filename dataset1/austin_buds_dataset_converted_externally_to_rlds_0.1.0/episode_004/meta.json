  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a pot with a lid, a plate, and a spatula-like tool. The robot must first take the lid off the pot. Then it must grasp the pot and place it onto the plate, ensuring stable contact. Finally, using the spatula as a tool, the robot pushes the pot toward the front of the table. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, stable grasping, gentle placement, and deliberate tool-mediated pushing.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are within the workspace and visible.",
      "Gripper and perception are functional.",
      "Plate is stable and reachable on the table surface."

      "Detect and grasp the spatula tool.",
      "Push the pot toward the front edge of the table using the spatula.",
      "Release tool and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is off and not covering the pot.",
      "Pot rests on the plate with visible, stable contact.",
      "Pot is translated toward the front edge after pushing.",
      "No collisions with other objects beyond brief contact for pushing."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If pot or tool not detected: rescan and widen search.",
      "If grasp fails or is unstable: reopen gripper, recompute grasp, retry.",
      "If placement misaligned: lift slightly and re-place.",
      "If push direction is off: re-align and re-execute push."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after the pot sits on the plate and has been pushed forward, with the gripper empty and arm safely retreated."
