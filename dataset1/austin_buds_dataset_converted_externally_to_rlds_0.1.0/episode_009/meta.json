  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The scene shows a tabletop with a small pot (initially lidded), a white plate, a spatula tool, and a larger bowl/pot on a brown surface. The robot must first remove the pot’s lid, then pick and place the pot onto the plate. Finally, it must grasp the spatula and use it to push the pot (sitting on the plate) toward the front edge of the table, aligning with the visual progression across frames. Movements are moderate in speed and accuracy, with standard grasping and gentle placement on the plate.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot within reach of pot, plate, and spatula",

      "Use the spatula to push the pot-on-plate toward the table front.",
