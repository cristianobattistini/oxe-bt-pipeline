  "task_summary": "Remove the lid from the small pot, place the pot on the plate, then use the spatula to push the pot toward the front edge of the table.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a small lidded pot on a stove panel, a plate and a spatula on the black mat, and a larger saucepan nearby. The robot must first unlatch or lift off the lid from the small pot. Next, it must grasp the pot and relocate it onto the plate on the mat. Finally, it should grasp the spatula and push the pot forward (toward the table’s near edge). The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, stable grasps, safe placement on the plate, and a controlled tool-mediated push.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Small pot, its lid, the plate, and the spatula are present and reachable",
      "Workspace is free of obstacles along the planned paths",
      "Gripper and tool affordances are compatible with pot and spatula geometry",
      "Controller gains and force limits are set for safe interaction"

      "Perceive the pot and its lid; open (remove) the lid.",
      "Align to the pot, compute a side grasp, and grasp the pot.",
      "Lift slightly, move above the plate, and place the pot on the plate.",
      "Retreat, then perceive and grasp the spatula.",
      "Approach the pot with the tool and push it toward the front of the table.",
      "Final retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is off and not re-contacting the pot",
      "Pot rests stably on the plate without toppling or sliding off",
      "Pot is pushed toward the front by the specified distance without tipping",
      "No collisions with burners, walls, or the large pan; tool released or safely held at end"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If perception fails, re-run DetectObject with a short scan pattern",
      "If grasp is unstable, retry grasp pose computation and re-grasp",
      "If placement misaligns, lift, re-approach, and re-place",
      "If push stalls, adjust approach and repeat push with smaller distance"
    ],
    "termination": "Tree succeeds after the final retreat following a successful push; aborts on unrecoverable timeouts."
