  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a robotic arm operating near a pot with a lid, a round plate on a dark mat, and a spatula-like tool. The robot must first remove the lid from the pot, then grasp and place the pot onto the plate. After placement, the robot must use the tool to push the pot toward the front (operator-facing) edge of the table. The behavior tree sequences perception, manipulation, placement, and tool-mediated pushing with short, binned timeouts.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are on the table and visible.",

    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid fully removed from the pot.",
      "Pot stably resting on the plate.",
      "Pot pushed toward the front edge, noticeably closer than before.",
      "No collisions that displace other objects off the workspace."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If opening the lid fails, re-perceive and retry.",
      "If grasp is unstable, recompute grasp pose and attempt again.",
      "If placement misaligns, regrasp or re-place onto plate.",
      "If push distance is insufficient, perform an additional push."
    ],
