  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene shows a robot arm, a lidded pot, a white plate, a spatula-like tool, a large bowl, and a mock stovetop on a dark tablecloth. The robot must first open the pot by removing its lid, then grasp the pot and relocate it to the plate. After placing and releasing the pot, the robot must pick up the spatula tool and push the pot toward the front edge of the table. Movements should remain collision-aware with gentle press forces when placing and controlled direction for the push.",

    "success_criteria": ["Lid is opened and left off the pot", "Pot rests stably centered on the plate", "Pot is pushed toward the front by at least the commanded distance", "No collisions or spills occur"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, rescan the workspace", "If lid opening fails, re-approach and retry opening", "If grasp slips, recompute grasp and retry", "If push deviates, realign and re-push with reduced distance"],
    "termination": "Terminate after the final retreat once the pot has been placed on the plate and pushed toward the front by the specified distance."
