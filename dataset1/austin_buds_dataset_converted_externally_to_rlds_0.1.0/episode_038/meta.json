  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a pot with a lid, a plate to its left, a spatula-like tool, and a bowl/pan. The robot must first remove the lid from the pot, then grasp and move the pot to place it on the plate. Finally, using the available tool (spatula), the robot should push the pot toward the front edge of the table to bring it closer to the operator. Motions should be orderly with brief timeouts and low placing force to avoid tipping.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot has access to spatula tool", "Pot, lid, and plate are visible", "Workspace is clear for pushing motion", "Gripper operational"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Perceive pot, lid, plate, and tool", "OpenContainer on the lid to remove it", "Compute grasp for the pot and execute grasp", "Lift/hold the pot briefly", "Place pot on the plate with gentle press", "Use spatula to push pot toward table front", "Retreat and wait briefly"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid is no longer on pot", "Pot rests stably on plate", "Pot is pushed toward and closer to front table edge", "No collisions or spills"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception failure → re-detect targets", "Grasp unstable → retry compute grasp and regrasp", "Place misaligned → re-place with adjusted yaw", "Push blocked → adjust direction and repeat push"],
    "termination": "End when the pot is on the plate and has been pushed toward the table front, with robot safely retreated."
