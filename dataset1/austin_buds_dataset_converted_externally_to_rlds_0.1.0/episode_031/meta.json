  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a small pot with a lid, a plate, a spatula-like tool, and a larger bowl/pan. The robot must first remove the lid from the pot. Next, it grasps the pot and relocates it onto the plate. Finally, the robot grasps the spatula and uses it to push the pot toward the front of the table, aligning it closer to the table edge. The sequence prioritizes reliable perception, safe grasps, and controlled planar pushing with the tool.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are present on the table",
      "Free workspace in front of the robot",

      "Release pot and retreat.",
      "Compute grasp for spatula; grasp the tool.",
      "Push the pot with the spatula toward the front edge of the table.",
      "Place the tool back on the table and retreat."

      "Lid is removed from pot",
