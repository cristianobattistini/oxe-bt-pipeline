  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene shows a robot arm, a pot with a lid, a small plate, and a spatula-like tool on a work surface. The robot first perceives the relevant objects, then opens (removes) the lid from the pot. After aligning to the pot, it grasps the pot from the top, transfers it, and places it onto the plate. Finally, leveraging the nearby spatula as a pushing aid, the robot pushes the pot forward toward the tableâ€™s front edge to achieve the final position.",

    "success_criteria": ["Lid is removed from pot", "Pot is resting on the plate stably", "Pot is pushed toward and near the front edge of the table", "Robot ends clear of objects"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, re-detect or adjust viewpoint", "If grasp slips, re-align and re-pick", "If placement misses the plate, re-place with smaller tolerance", "If push direction drifts, re-align push vector and repeat"],
