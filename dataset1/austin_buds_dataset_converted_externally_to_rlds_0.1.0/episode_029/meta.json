  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop robot manipulator operates over a board with circular stove markers, a plate, a pot with a lid, a bowl, and a spatula-like tool. The robot must first disengage the lid from the pot, then grasp the pot securely and place it onto the nearby plate. After placing and releasing the pot, the robot re-grasps the spatula tool and performs a controlled push to slide the pot toward the front edge of the table, keeping motions planar and avoiding collisions with the bowl or board fixtures.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, plate, and spatula are visible within reachable workspace",
      "Lid is initially on the pot",
      "Table surface is clear enough to slide the pot",

      "Release the pot and retreat",
      "Grasp the spatula tool",
      "Push the pot toward the table front"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is no longer covering the pot",
      "Pot rests stably centered on the plate",
      "Pot is pushed forward by the specified distance without tipping"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If grasp is unstable, retry alignment and re-grasp",
      "If placement misses the plate, lift and re-place using tighter tolerance",
      "If push stalls due to friction, re-approach with tool and increase push distance incrementally"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after the pot is on the plate and has been pushed to the front by the commanded distance with no active contacts."
