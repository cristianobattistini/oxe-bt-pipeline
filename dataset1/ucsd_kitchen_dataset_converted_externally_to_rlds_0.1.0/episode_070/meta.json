  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode tasks a robot arm with picking up a canned spam from a countertop and dropping or placing it in the sink basin. The robot must visually locate the spam can, approach from the side for a stable grasp, transport the can above the sink, and release it. The scene is a toy kitchen with structured objects (cabinet, sink, faucet, utensils) and minimal clutter. The activity must avoid collisions and ensure the can lands in the sink area.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Spam can placed upright on counter within arm reach.",

      "Spam can is located and picked up by the gripper.",
