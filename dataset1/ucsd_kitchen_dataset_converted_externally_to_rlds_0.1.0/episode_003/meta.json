  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a robot arm interacting within a kitchen environment. The arm must identify the teapot, approach it, grasp securely, transfer and align above the stove, then place the teapot onto the stove surface and release. The robot must handle constraints such as visibility, proper grasp, stable placement, and retreat safely after completion. The scaffolded behavior adapts to perception failures and ensures compliant manipulation using minimal force and tight spatial tolerance as inferred from the visual evidence.",
