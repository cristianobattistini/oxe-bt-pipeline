    "overview": "This episode centers on a robot tasked with picking up a bowl from the kitchen counter and placing it inside a cabinet. The contact sheet displays the robot arm perceiving, approaching, grasping the bowl, transferring it, opening the cabinet, and placing the bowl inside. All handling motions are sequential and precise, with the robot ensuring object visibility and stable grasp before transferring. If needed, visual scanning is performed for the bowl or cabinet. The system opens the cabinet before inserting the bowl, then completes the task.",
