    "overview": "A mobile manipulator is commanded to pick up a bowl resting on the kitchen counter and place it inside an open kitchen cabinet. The robot must perceive the bowl, approach and grasp it from above, lift and transport it to the position above the cabinet, then place it inside, and retreat. Visual cues in the episode indicate one-handed pick-and-place, no cabinet door manipulation, and the use of a top grasp strategy. Movement and gripper actions are sequenced for reliable transfer between surfaces.",

      "The bowl is clearly visible and accessible on the kitchen counter.",

      "Visually locate the kitchen cabinet.",
      "Move the bowl above the cabinet entry.",
      "Place the bowl inside with a gentle press.",
      "Open the gripper to release.",
      "Retreat the arm from the cabinet."

    "success_criteria": [
      "The bowl is stably inside the kitchen cabinet.",
      "No significant bowl spillage or tipping occurs.",
      "The gripper is released and clear of the cabinet after placement."

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If the bowl is not visible, re-attempt visual scan.",
      "If grasp fails, retry grasp procedure up to three times.",
      "If the cabinet is not visible, perform a scan for it."

    "termination": "Task completes once the bowl is placed in the cabinet, gripper is open, and robot has exited the cabinet."
