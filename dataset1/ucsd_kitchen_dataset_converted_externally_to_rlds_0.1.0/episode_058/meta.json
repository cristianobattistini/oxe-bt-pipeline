  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a robot arm using visual and motion primitives to pick up a teapot and move it onto a stove within a toy kitchen scene. The process includes object search, approach, stable grasp, lift, transfer, place down, and gripper release. Real-world constraints such as vision-based alignment, collision-avoidance, and controlled placement are managed via sub-steps. All actions occur in a compact workspace with high precision and visibility required to manipulate the teapot onto the stove area.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Teapot is present and unobstructed on the counter.",
      "Stove is clear and accessible.",
      "Robot is powered and actuators are homed.",

      "Visually confirm or reacquire the teapot.",

      "Verify grasp stability.",
      "Visually reacquire the stove area.",
      "Move above stove in a safe transfer trajectory.",
      "Place teapot onto stove surface; release gripper.",
      "Retreat from the placement site, wait to ensure completion."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Teapot is fully released and supported on stove.",
      "No collision or spill during pick-transfer-place.",
      "All actions complete sequentially."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Failure to detect objects triggers scan or retry.",
      "Unstable grasp triggers regrasp subloops.",
