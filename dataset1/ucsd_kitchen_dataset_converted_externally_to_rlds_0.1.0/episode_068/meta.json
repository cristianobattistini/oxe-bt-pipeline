  "task_summary": "The robot must open the oven door using a structured sequence involving perception, approach, alignment, actuation, verification, and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a robotic arm operating in a kitchen environment. The main goal is to open the oven door. The robot begins with locating and verifying the oven door, plans a safe approach above it, aligns with the handle or activation zone, actuates the opening maneuver, checks that the door is indeed open, and finally retreats from the workspace. This task requires careful perception, motion planning, robust interaction, and post-actuation verification. Constraints include accurate oven door localization and avoiding collision with the environment.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot arm is calibrated and able to reach oven area.",
      "Oven door handle or front is unobstructed.",

      "Verify that oven door is open.",
      "Safely retreat from oven."
