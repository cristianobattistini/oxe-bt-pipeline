  "task_summary": "The robot is instructed to open the cabinet door, which is performed by perceiving the door, approaching and aligning to it, performing the opening action, verifying the door is open, and retreating.

    "overview": "This episode captures a robot tasked with opening the cabinet door above a kitchen sink area. The scene includes a white cabinet door, robotic arm, and countertop. The robot performs perception, localization, alignment, actuation to open the door, verification of success, and a retreat movement. Task constraints include visual confirmation and careful approach to avoid collision; no objects are grasped or manipulated besides the cabinet door itself.",
