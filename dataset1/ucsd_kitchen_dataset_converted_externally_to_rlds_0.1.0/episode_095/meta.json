    "overview": "A stationary manipulator is tasked to open the oven door of a toy kitchen. The task involves localizing the oven door, approaching and aligning the arm to its handle, actuating the motion to open the hinged door, and verifying it is open. Environmental constraints include the limited reach of the manipulator, potential occlusions, and the fixed positions of other kitchen items.",
