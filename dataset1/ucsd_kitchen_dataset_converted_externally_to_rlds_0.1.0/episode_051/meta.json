    "overview": "This behavior tree directs a fixed-base manipulator to open a lower oven door. The robot uses visual perception to find the oven door, aligns and approaches, computes and executes a side-on grasp on the handle, actuates the door open, confirms success, and finally retreats to a safe distance. The workspace includes a countertop, sink, and visible appliance surfaces. The robot must account for occlusions and correct pose estimation, employing moderate force and precision but has no explicit retry or force constraints dictated by the instruction or frames.",
