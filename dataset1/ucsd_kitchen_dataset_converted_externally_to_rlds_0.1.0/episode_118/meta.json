    "overview": "This task involves a robot arm interacting with a kitchen scene containing a teapot and a toy stove. The aim is to locate the teapot, approach and grasp it, transfer (move) it towards the stove, and execute a precise placement onto the stove's surface. The process requires vision-driven perception, grasp computation, and coordinated manipulation, all enacted in discrete, observable phases. The demonstration proceeds through phases of approach, grasp, transfer, and place, demanding spatial awareness, stable manipulation, and collision constraint adherence.",
