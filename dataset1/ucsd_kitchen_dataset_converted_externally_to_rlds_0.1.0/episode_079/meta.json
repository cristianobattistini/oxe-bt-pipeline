    "overview": "The robot is assigned to open the oven door in a kitchen setup. The oven door is located beneath the counter surface and is initially closed. The manipulator must visually find the door, precisely align, compute a pulling grasp, securely grasp the door handle or edge, pull the door open, confirm that it is opened, and then retreat from the workspace. The process avoids excessive force and ensures safety.",
