  "task_summary": "A robot arm must pick up a teapot and place it precisely on the stove, following robust object localization and manipulation steps, as captured across nine sequential frames.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The episode presents a fixed kitchen scene in which a robot arm is tasked with transferring a teapot onto the stove surface. Key objects are the teapot and stove, both visible and accessible. The robot first locates and grasps the teapot, lifts it, moves above the stove, and places the teapot gently. The sequence reflects accurate visual detection, precise grasping, and deliberate placement, with actions mapped directly to observed behaviors. No explicit constraint for force or speed is seen; the task centers on spatial correctness.",
