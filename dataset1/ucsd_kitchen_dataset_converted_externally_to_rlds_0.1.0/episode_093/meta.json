  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a mobile manipulator robot tasked with opening a front-loading oven door, situated in a kitchen environment. The robot must first perceive the oven door, approach and align its end effector, compute and execute a grasp suitable for pulling, then apply sufficient pulling force to open the door, and finally retreat once the opening is verified. The task involves robust perception, precise alignment, reliable grasping, and feedback-driven manipulation, operating within physical constraints of the oven and workspace.",
