    "overview": "This task involves a robotic manipulator interacting with a toy kitchen oven. It must visually locate the oven door, approach and align its end effector to the handle, compute an appropriate grasp pose for pulling, then execute the pull motion to open the door. After confirming that the oven door is now open, the robot retreats from the workspace. All steps are visually monitored and performed in a precise manner to avoid collisions and ensure successful completion.",
