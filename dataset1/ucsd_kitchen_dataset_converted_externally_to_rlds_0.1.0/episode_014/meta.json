  "task_summary": "The robot is tasked to place a bowl inside a kitchen cabinet by perceiving, grasping, and relocating the bowl onto the interior shelf, with correct opening and placement actions.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, a robot arm performs a pick-and-place task in a kitchen scene, moving a bowl from the countertop into the interior shelf of the kitchen cabinet. The robot first locates and verifies the bowl visually, opens its gripper, approaches and computes a grasp, then picks up the bowl securely. Upon confirming the grasp, the robot ensures the cabinet is open (and opens it if needed), moves above the cabinet shelf, carefully places the bowl onto the shelf surface, releases it, and retreats. Key constraints are reliable perception, non-damaging grasp, and robust handling of the cabinet (open before place).",
