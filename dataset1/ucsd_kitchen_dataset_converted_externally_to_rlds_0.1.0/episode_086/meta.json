    "overview": "This task requires a robot arm to perceive, approach, and open the oven door in a kitchen setting. The workspace contains an oven/cabinet module; the oven door is initially closed. The robot must locate the handle/edge, align its gripper, grasp, actuate the door open, and confirm completion. Visual perception and sequential manipulation ensure safe, successful actuation.",
