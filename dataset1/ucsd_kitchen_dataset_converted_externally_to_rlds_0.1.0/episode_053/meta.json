  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, a robotic arm situated in a toy kitchen scene is instructed to open the oven door. The environment features a kitchen setup with a prominent oven, cupboards, and a work surface. The oven door is visually identifiable and assumed closed at the start. The robot must visually locate the door, approach and align its end effector with the door’s handle/edge, then pull the door open by applying an appropriate motion along the correct axis. Scene constraints include possible occlusions and the requirement for accurate approach and actuation, with termination upon confirming that the oven door is indeed open.",
