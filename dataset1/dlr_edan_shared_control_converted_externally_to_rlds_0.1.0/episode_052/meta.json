  "task_summary": "The robot arm is tasked to pick the orange fruit from a tabletop among other objects. This involves detection, approach, grasp pose computation, gentle contact, grasp execution, and confirmation of the orange being secured in the gripper.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, a blue robotic arm picks up an orange from a small table. The scene includes clearly visible fruit (apple, banana, orange), white cubes, and background shelving. The robot uses visual perception to locate the orange, approaches from above, computes the grasp pose, lowers until contact, and gently closes its gripper. Task progress is monitored stepwise, ending with verification that the orange is held securely. The episode prioritizes safe, direct motion and minimal disturbance to other items.",
