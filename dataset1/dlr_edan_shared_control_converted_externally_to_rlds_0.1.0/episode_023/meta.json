  "task_summary": "The robot is instructed to pick up a disk from a shelf using a sequential manipulation policy; the scene involves perception, approach, grasp, and transfer steps visible across nine frames.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode consists of a robotic arm executing the 'pick the disk' instruction using visual guidance and manipulation primitives. The scene shows the robot starting remotely from the shelf, incrementally approaching and aligning with the front right disk. The robot opens its gripper, computes a suitable top grasp, aligns, grasps the disk with a moderate force and retreats. All steps unfold in a tidy workspace, with a dark cubby shelf and several visible cylindrical disks. No human interference is present; process constraints are clear visibility and precise disk targeting.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot arm and gripper are initialized.",
      "Disk is located on the shelf and visually accessible.",

      "Failure: Disk not detected due to occlusion.",
