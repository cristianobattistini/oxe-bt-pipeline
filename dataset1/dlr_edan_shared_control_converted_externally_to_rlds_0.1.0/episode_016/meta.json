    "overview": "The robot is instructed to pick a tube placed in a lower shelf cell. The robot must visually detect the tube, plan an approach from above, grasp it using a pinch strategy, and lift it vertically. The tube appears white, cylindrical, and placed horizontally in the shelf structure. The scene does not show distractions but involves spatial constraints.",
