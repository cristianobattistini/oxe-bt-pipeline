  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a robot arm in a kitchen-like environment, tasked to locate and pick a cylindrical tube resting in a shelf cubby. The robot first perceives the tube, verifies its visibility, positions itself for a top grasp, aligns above the object, executes the grasp, and then retreats with the tube. Key roles include visual detection, motion planning, and manipulative action, with constraints arising from tight workspace geometry and occlusions from the shelf.",
