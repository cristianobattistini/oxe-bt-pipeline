    "overview": "This episode shows a blue robotic arm tasked with picking up a white disk from the top-right compartment of a black shelving unit in a clean indoor lab environment. The disk is spatially isolated as the clear target among other distracting objects (such as a flower). The robot executes visual search, approaches above the disk, prepares the gripper, plans a top-style grasp, aligns, grasps at pose, verifies in-gripper, and retreats after securing the disk. Main constraints are accurate perception of the disk, safe approach, proper grasp strategy, and stable pickup.",
