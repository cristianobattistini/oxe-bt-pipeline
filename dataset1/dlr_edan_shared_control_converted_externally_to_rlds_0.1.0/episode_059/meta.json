    "overview": "A blue/white robot arm is situated in a kitchen/lab space and must pick up a white disk object placed on a black shelf. The sequence involves perceiving the disk, approaching it, aligning above, computing a grasp, executing the grasp, verifying contrived success, and retreating post-grasp. This follows standard manipulation and perception constraints for tabletop pick-and-place tasks.",
