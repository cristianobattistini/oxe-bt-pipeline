  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a robotic arm tasked to pick a white die positioned on the shelf. The robot first detects the die, then approaches by opening the gripper and positioning itself above. Next, it computes a top grasp pose, aligns precisely, executes the grasp, and verifies the die is held. The environment includes furniture and non-task objects, but the focus remains on manipulating the die. Accuracy in perception and alignment are essential.",
