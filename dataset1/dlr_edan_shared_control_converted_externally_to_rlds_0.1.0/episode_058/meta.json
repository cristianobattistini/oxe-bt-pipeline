  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a robotic manipulator operating in a domestic or lab setting, instructed to pick up a small white cylindrical tube from the top surface of a dark cube shelf. The scene contains another white object (likely a block) and assorted background furniture. The robot must detect the tube, position its end-effector above it, prepare the gripper, compute and execute a grasp from the side, and verify successful grasp using visual and proprioceptive cues. No placing or transfer is requested. The tube is the exclusive target; all other objects remain untouched.",
