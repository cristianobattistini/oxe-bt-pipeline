    "overview": "This episode demonstrates a robot arm executing a pick action on a tube-shaped object located in a shelving unit within a lab/kitchen environment. The scene contains a shelf with multiple objects, but sequence frames focus on the tube, which is approached and grasped by the robot. The robot must correctly perceive the tube, open its gripper, approach with appropriate alignment, compute a grasp pose, execute the grasp using a top strategy, confirm acquisition, and retreat. Constraints include ensuring the tube is visible, stable grasp, and avoidance of collision with shelf or other objects.",

      "Tube object is present and unobstructed in shelf cubby.",
