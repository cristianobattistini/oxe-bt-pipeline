    "overview": "This episode demonstrates a robot using visual perception followed by motion planning to pick up a single green apple resting on a lower shelf. The environment contains several distractor white objects and a flowerpot on the shelf above. The sequence entails re-locating the green apple if needed, approaching it from above, aligning, grasping with a top strategy, confirming the grasp, and finally lifting the apple. The focus is on stable and reliable object pickup amidst nearby obstacles.",
    "preconditions": [
