    "overview": "This episode demonstrates a robot arm executing the instruction 'pick the die.' The scene involves a shelf with cubby holes, a small die placed inside one compartment, and a blue articulated robotic arm approaching and grasping it. The behavior is constrained by accurate visual perception of the die and careful maneuvering for a successful grasp. The robot's gripper opens, aligns above the die, lowers carefully until contact, then closes with moderate force. Completion is verified by stable grasp detection.",
