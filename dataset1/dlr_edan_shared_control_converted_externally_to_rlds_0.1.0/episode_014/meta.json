    "overview": "The robot is instructed to pick a green pear placed among other fruits on a glass surface near a dark shelf. It must detect the pear, plan and execute a grasp using a top-pinch strategy, and lift it vertically after securing the object. The scene includes distractor objects (e.g., apple) and constrained table geometry.",
