  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A robot arm equipped for wiping interacts with a horizontal board surface. The task is to erase markings (visible in initial frames) by executing a wiping sequence. The robot first localizes the board, moves above and aligns, then performs a line-pattern wipe with two passes over the marked region. After task completion, it retreats from the board. Visual evidence confirms presence of the robotic end-effector, board, and erased area. Constraints include precise board localization and adequate physical coverage.",
