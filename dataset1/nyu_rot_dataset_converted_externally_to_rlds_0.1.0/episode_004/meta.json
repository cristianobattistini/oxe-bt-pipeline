  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a robotic arm performing the task of hanging a mug onto a vertical metallic hook within a tabletop environment. The main objects are a blue mug and a tall metallic hook. The robot must identify and localize both objects, grasp the mug (by its side), align and approach the hook, perform a hanging action with proper orientation and approach angle, then release and retract. Constraints include gentle but stable grasping and precise placement on the hook.",

      "Mug and hook are present and detectable in workspace",
