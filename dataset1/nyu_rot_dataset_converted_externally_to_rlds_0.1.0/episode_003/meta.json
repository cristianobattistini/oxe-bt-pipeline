  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode requires a robot arm to open a small storage box situated on a tabletop. The box has a hinged or removable lid. The robot must visually locate the box, approach and align above the lid, compute a suitable grasp pose (top grasp), execute the grasp, and actuate the lid opening action. Once open, the robot confirms success, retreats, and waits. Visual perception is used to guide actions and confirm progress.",
