    "overview": "In this episode, a robot arm is tasked to reach a blue pen located across a tabletop while avoiding a stack of books acting as an obstacle. The robot must perceive the pen, plan a route around the obstacle, and incrementally move past the books before approaching the pen. Visual feedback and waypointing are used to ensure successful navigation, overcoming occlusions and restricted paths.",
