    "overview": "This episode features a white articulated robot arm operating on a tabletop cluttered with books (obstacle) and a blue pen standing upright in a holder. The goal is to navigate from the left side of the books to the pen, requiring perception of both objects and a collision‑free approach. Robust perception and alignment are critical due to occlusions and possible workspace constraints.",
