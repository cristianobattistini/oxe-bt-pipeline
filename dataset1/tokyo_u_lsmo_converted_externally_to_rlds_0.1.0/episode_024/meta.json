  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A single robotic arm is required to reach the blue pen on the table while avoiding the obstacle formed by a stack of books. The workspace includes the pen, books obstructing the direct path, and a pen holder. The robot perceives the pen, plans a safe approach trajectory to bypass the books, and then moves to the pen. Both perception and navigation are sequential and explicit. All steps monitor success before proceeding.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Blue pen is present and visible on the table.",
