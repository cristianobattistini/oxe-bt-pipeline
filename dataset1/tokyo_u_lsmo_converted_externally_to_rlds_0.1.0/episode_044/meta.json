    "overview": "This scene takes place on a tabletop where a robot arm must move its end-effector from one side of a stack of books (serving as an obstacle) to reach a blue pen placed in a holder on the far side. The books block direct access; the robot must first perceive the pen, plan a safe path, move above or around the obstacle, and approach the pen.",
