    "overview": "A manipulator robot situated on a desk must move past a set of books (obstacle) to reach the blue pen placed upright in a holder. The robot perceives the pen, approaches while avoiding collision with the books, aligns its end-effector above and near the pen, and moves precisely to the pen's position. All actions are based on visual input with verification steps.",
