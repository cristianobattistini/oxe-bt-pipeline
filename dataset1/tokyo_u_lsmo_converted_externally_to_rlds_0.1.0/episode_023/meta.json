  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this tabletop scene, a robot arm is tasked to reach a vertical blue pen placed in a box, bypassing obstacles (books) situated directly between its start and the goal. The arm perceives the pen and obstacles, approaches from above, and uses a precise alignment to avoid collision before arriving at the pen. The process emphasizes collision avoidance, target localization, and reaching reliably.",

      "Robot arm is initialized at start position.",
