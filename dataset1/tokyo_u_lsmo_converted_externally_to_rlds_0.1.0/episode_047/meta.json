    "overview": "This episode features a single-armed robot operating on a tabletop workspace. The primary objective is to reach the blue pen placed behind a stack of books, which act as obstacles. The robot is required to detect the pen, plan a collision-free approach, circumvent the blocking books, and align precisely with the pen to reach it without contact.",

      "Locate the blue pen using perception.",
      "Move the end-effector above the pen, avoiding collisions.",
