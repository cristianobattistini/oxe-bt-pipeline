  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This scenario involves a robot arm positioned behind a set of obstacles (books) that must reach the blue pen placed in a holder on a table. The system must avoid collision with the books while planning an approach path to the blue pen. The arm begins in a standby position, perceives the goal, avoids the obstructing books, aligns for a reaching maneuver, and navigates to the target.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot system is powered, calibrated, and ready.",

      "Robot end-effector reaches the blue pen location without colliding with obstacles.",

      "If pen is not visible, scanning is retried up to 3 times.",
      "If movement is blocked or collision is detected, execution halts before contact.",
      "If approach fails, the sequence resumes from perception."

    "termination": "Behavior ends when the robot is confirmed at the blue pen's location or perception/approach fails beyond retries."
