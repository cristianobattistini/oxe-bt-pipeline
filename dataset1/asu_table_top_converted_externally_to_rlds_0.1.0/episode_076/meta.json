    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator must pick a small white box from a cluttered tabletop that also includes a red block, green bottle, cans, and orange stacked cups. The robot first ensures the gripper is open, detects the white box, computes a grasp pose, then approaches from above, aligns, grasps, and lifts. The sequence emphasizes reliable perception and verification of grasp stability before raising the object.",

    "success_criteria": ["White box securely held after lift", "No collisions with other objects", "Positive object-in-gripper confirmation"],
