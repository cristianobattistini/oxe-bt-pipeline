  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows multiple small objects (red cylinder, orange bottle, green bottle, blue bottle, and a translucent/white box) with a 6-DOF arm above. The instruction is to put down the white box. The behavior first ensures the box is in the gripper, attempting a simple top grasp if needed. The robot then moves above the designated table placement area, places the box with low force, opens the gripper to release, and retreats to clear the scene.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot and table are clear of obstacles along approach path",
      "White box visible or its pose can be detected",

      "If not already holding the box, open gripper, detect the white box, compute a top grasp, execute grasp, and verify stability.",

      "Place the box onto the table with gentle force and correct yaw.",
      "Open gripper to release the box.",
      "Retreat to a safe distance."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "White box is released and resting stably on the table",
      "No other objects are toppled or displaced beyond tolerance",
      "Arm ends in a safe, collision-free pose away from the objects"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Perception failure: re-detect the object and recompute grasp",
      "Grasp instability: reattempt grasp with the same top strategy",
      "Placement contact not detected: lower further or retry placement",
      "Obstruction during transfer: adjust approach and replan move-above"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate when the box is released on the table and the arm has retreated by the specified distance."
