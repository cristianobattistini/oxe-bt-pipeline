  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm on a white semicircular table must push a blue Pepsi can to a new location. Other distractor objects are present: a red soda can, a red rectangular block, an orange cuboid, a clear plastic cup, and a green bottle. The robot should first locate the Pepsi can, approach and align the tool center point, ensure the gripper is open, then execute a controlled push in the intended lateral direction. The push should translate the can without tipping or colliding with neighboring items, followed by a brief retreat and pause.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pepsi can visible on table and reachable",
      "Workspace free along intended push path",

      "Retreat to clear the object and wait briefly."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Blue Pepsi can translates approximately 0.20 m along the table in the commanded direction",
      "No tipping or loss of stability of the can",
      "No collisions with other objects",
      "Robot returns to a safe clearance after pushing"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails: rescan with the scanning action and reattempt detection.",
      "If alignment is off: repeat ApproachAndAlign before pushing.",
      "If contact slips or the can tips: retreat, re-approach, and execute a shorter push.",
      "If the path is blocked: retreat and select a shorter distance or different direction."
    ],
    "termination": "Tree ends after the push completes successfully and the robot retreats and waits."
