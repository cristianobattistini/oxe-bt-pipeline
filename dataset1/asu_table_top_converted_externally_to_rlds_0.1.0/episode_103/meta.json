  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows multiple small objects (cans, cups, bottles) and a robot arm operating over a white table. The goal is to place the red can onto the table. If the can is not already held, the robot detects it, computes a top grasp, and grasps it. With the can secured, the arm aligns above the table, performs a controlled placement onto the surface with low press force, opens the gripper to release, and retreats to clear the workspace while keeping nearby objects safe.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear enough to place the can on the table.", "Robot is powered and homed; gripper functional.", "Table surface is reachable by the manipulator."],
    "stepwise_plan": ["If not holding the red can, detect it and grasp with a top strategy.", "Align above the table within tight tolerance.", "Place the can on the table with minimal press force and nominal yaw.", "Open the gripper to release.", "Retreat a short distance and pause briefly."],
    "success_criteria": ["Red can rests stably on the table without tipping.", "No collision with other objects.", "Gripper fully opens and the can is no longer in the gripper."],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, re-run detection and grasp sequence.", "If placement is misaligned, re-approach and re-place.", "If grasp is unstable, re-grasp before attempting placement."],
    "termination": "Terminate after retreat and brief wait following a successful release on the table."
