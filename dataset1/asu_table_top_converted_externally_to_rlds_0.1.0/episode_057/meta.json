    "overview": "A 6-DOF robot arm with a parallel gripper is already holding a small maroon cylinder over a white table. The scene contains a green bottle, a blue can, orange items on the right, and a clear cup. The goal is to approach a clear spot on the table, make controlled contact with the surface, release the maroon object, and retreat without disturbing neighbors. Motions should be straight and gentle during touchdown to avoid tipping.",
    "preconditions": ["Maroon object is currently in the gripper", "Target place area on the table is free of obstacles", "Robot has collision model for table height"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Verify the object is in hand", "Move above the intended place spot", "Approach and align precisely over the spot", "Lower until contact with limited force", "Open gripper to release", "Retreat vertically to a safe height"],
    "success_criteria": ["Maroon object ends upright and stationary on the table", "No collisions with other objects", "Gripper fully releases and retreats clear"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If contact is not detected within depth limit, re-approach and try again", "If release slips object, regrasp if safe or choose a new spot", "If alignment fails, repeat approach with widened tolerance"],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful release and retreat to a safe clearance pose."
