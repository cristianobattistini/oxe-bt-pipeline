  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator must pick up a small brown object from a cluttered tabletop containing colored bottles/cylinders. The robot first perceives the scene, verifies the brown target, prepares by opening the gripper, approaches and aligns for a precise grasp, executes a side grasp, confirms the object is secured, and lifts it a short distance to complete the pickup. No placement is required. Movements should be careful yet efficient to avoid disturbing nearby items.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is homed and within workspace reach of the table.", "Camera feed available to detect the brown object.", "Gripper operational and empty.", "Table surface is stable."],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect the brown object.", "Verify visual availability.", "Open the gripper to the target width.", "Approach and align to grasp pose with tight tolerance.", "Execute side-grasp pick.", "Confirm object is in gripper.", "Raise the held object slightly above the table."],
    "success_criteria": ["Object is firmly grasped (no slip).", "Object lifted at least 0.10 m above table.", "No collision with other objects."],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, retry detection.", "If alignment fails, re-approach with the same tolerance.", "If grasp fails, reopen gripper and retry pick.", "If slip detected, re-attempt pick after retreating slightly."],
    "termination": "Terminate when the object is detected in the gripper and lifted the target distance."
