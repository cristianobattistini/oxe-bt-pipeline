    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene shows several small bottles and cups. The robot arm must move the green glass bottle from its initial position to a new location on the table. The plan detects and verifies visibility, computes a side grasp, aligns and grasps, lifts to clear neighbors, then places with small press force and tolerance before retreating. Timeouts and distances are conservative to avoid collisions with nearby objects of various colors spread across the workspace.",
