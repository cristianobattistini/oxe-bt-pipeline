    "overview": "A UR-style robotic arm faces a tabletop with multiple colored items: an orange stack, a tall red rectangular object near the center-left, a green bottle, a blue can, and a white carton. The goal is to pick up the red object. The behavior first perceives the target, approaches from above, computes a top grasp, executes the grasp, verifies stability, then raises the object a short distance and holds briefly. Timing bins, tolerances, and distances are chosen from the allowed spaces to be safe around nearby objects.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is homed with gripper operational and free of any object",

      "Verify grasp stability and lift the object slightly.",

      "Red object is securely grasped",

      "If detection fails, retry perception.",

      "If grasp slips, open gripper, retreat a bit, and recompute the grasp."
