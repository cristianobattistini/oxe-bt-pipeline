  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A stationary manipulator must pick a small green bottle from a cluttered tabletop. The arm first perceives the target, prepares the gripper, aligns over the object, computes a top grasp, executes the grasp, and then lifts the bottle slightly to verify a secure hold. The scene shows multiple distractor objects (red cylinder, blue can, brown item, clear cup) arranged around the target, so alignment and collision-free motion are important. The outcome is a stable lift with the bottle firmly in the gripper.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is homed and reachable workspace includes the bottle.",
      "Gripper empty and operational.",
      "Green bottle is on the table and visible.",

      "Execute the grasp at goal_pose and close the gripper.",
      "Lift the held bottle slightly to clear the surface.",
      "Verify object is in gripper and the grasp is stable."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "ObjectInGripper(green_bottle) evaluates true.",
      "IsGraspStable evaluates true after lift.",
      "Bottle lifted at least 0.10 m above the table without slip."

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Perception failure: re-run detection or adjust view.",
      "Misalignment: re-approach with tighter tolerance.",

      "Collision risk: retreat slightly and re-align."
