  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates over a cluttered tabletop with several bottles and cans (blue Pepsi can, red can, green bottle, tall red bottle, orange stack, small gray box). The goal is to gently place the Pepsi can on the table, aligned and stable, and then back off safely. The behavior first verifies the can is held, approaches a safe above-table pose, lowers until contact with low force, releases the gripper, waits briefly for stabilization, and retreats to clear the scene.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot has the Pepsi can in the gripper", "Table surface is clear at the chosen placement area", "Perception frame is valid and kinematics reachable"],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Verify the can is currently in the gripper.",
      "Move to a pose above the placement area on the table with small vertical offset.",
      "Lower slowly until contact is detected with low force.",
      "Open the gripper to release the can.",
      "Wait briefly to let the can settle.",
      "Retreat a short distance to clear the object."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Pepsi can ends upright and stationary on the table",
      "No collisions with nearby objects",
      "Gripper releases cleanly and robot retreats to a safe distance"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If object not in gripper: abort and request re-pick in upstream pipeline",
      "If contact not detected in max depth: retreat and retry approach",
      "If release slips the can: re-grasp if safe or signal operator"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after retreat once the can is placed and the manipulator is clear of the object."
