    "overview": "A 6-DoF arm holds a small red cube above a white tabletop populated by other objects (green bottle, blue can, orange cylinders, small gray block). The goal is to place the red cube down gently on the table surface near the central clear area, avoiding collisions and then retreating. The behavior emphasizes controlled approach, contact-aware lowering, opening the gripper to release, and backing away to clear the workspace.",
