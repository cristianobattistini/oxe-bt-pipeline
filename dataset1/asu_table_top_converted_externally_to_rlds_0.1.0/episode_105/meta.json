  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows multiple small items (cans, bottles, cup) and a rectangular bread-like item. The robot arm must move the bread without lifting it. The plan is to first ensure the bread is visible, then localize it precisely, approach and align the end-effector, execute a short push along the table surface to translate the bread, and finally retreat to a safe pose. No target goal marker is visible, so the move is interpreted as a short reposition.",
