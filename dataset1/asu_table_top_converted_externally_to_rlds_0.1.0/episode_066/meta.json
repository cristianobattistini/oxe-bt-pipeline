  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The scene shows a UR-style manipulator above a white tabletop with several objects arranged in a row: a small green bottle on the left, colored containers in the middle, and a taller red bottle on the right. The instruction is to move the green bottle. We interpret this as a lateral push on the table surface without grasping. The robot first detects and verifies the target, approaches while keeping the gripper open, aligns to the bottle, pushes it a short distance, and then retreats to a safe height.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is homed and within workspace limits", "Table surface is clear for a short lateral push", "Green bottle stands upright and is movable by contact", "Vision pipeline can detect 'green_bottle'"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect 'green_bottle'", "Move to pre-push pose above target", "Verify visibility of target", "Open gripper to avoid unintended grasp", "Approach and align to contact line", "Push bottle 10 cm along table x-axis (0°)", "Retreat to clear the object"],
    "success_criteria": ["Green bottle has a clearly different lateral position on the table", "No collision with other objects beyond gentle contact", "Robot ends in a safe, non-contact pose"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, re-run detection or scan area", "If alignment fails or slip occurs, retreat slightly and re-approach", "If push is obstructed, reduce distance and try a smaller push"],
    "termination": "Task terminates after a single successful push followed by a retreat."
