    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows multiple small bottles or containers of different colors arranged near the center of a white table, with a robot arm above. The instruction is to pick up the brown object. The behavior performs perception to localize the brown target, approaches and aligns for a top grasp, computes a grasp pose, executes the grasp with the gripper, verifies grasp stability, and then lifts the object slightly to confirm acquisition while avoiding collisions.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is powered, homed, and within reach of the workspace",

      "Close the gripper and verify grasp stability and that the object is held.",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Perception miss: detection retried up to 3 times",
      "Minor pose error: re-align then re-grasp",
      "Slip during lift: re-close gripper or retry grasp",
      "Occlusion: slight reposition then re-detect"
