    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator faces a semicircular white table with several small containers aligned near the table edge. The green bottle sits slightly right of center, near a tall pink cylinder and a blue can. The robot must detect the green bottle, align, plan a side pinch grasp, close the gripper, verify the grasp, and lift the bottle vertically to clear the surface without disturbing neighbors.",
