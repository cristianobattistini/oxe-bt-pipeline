  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A stationary manipulator must push a small brown/orange object resting on a white tabletop. Multiple distractors are present (blue can, central fixture, grey cup, red cup, green bottle). The robot should perceive the target, approach with the gripper open, align parallel to the desired push direction, execute a short planar push to the right, and then retreat to clear the scene. The push should translate the object without toppling it or colliding with neighbors.",
