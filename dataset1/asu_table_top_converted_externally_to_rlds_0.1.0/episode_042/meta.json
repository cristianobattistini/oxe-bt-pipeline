    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows several items (red cylinder, green bottle, cups/cans, orange figurines) with a robotic arm above. The instruction is to hold the red object. The behavior first detects and localizes the red object, aligns the end-effector, opens the gripper, executes a standard top grasp, verifies the grasp, and maintains a firm hold for a fixed duration without relocating the object. Timeouts and tolerances are conservative to ensure reliability amidst visual noise.",
