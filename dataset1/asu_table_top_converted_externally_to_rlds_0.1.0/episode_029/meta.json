  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator holds a green glass bottle above a cluttered tabletop with cups and cans distributed across the work surface. The goal is to place the bottle gently on the table, avoiding collisions with nearby objects, and then retreat to a safe height. The sequence assumes the bottle is already grasped and stable. The robot approaches a placement area, lowers until contact is detected at low force, releases the gripper, and backs away to clear the object.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Green glass bottle is already grasped and stable",
      "Table surface area for placement is free of obstacles at the chosen spot",

      "Verify the bottle is currently in the gripper.",

      "Lower until contact at low force and limited depth.",
      "Open the gripper to release the bottle onto the table.",
      "Retreat to a safe distance from the placed object."

      "Bottle rests stably on the table without toppling",
      "No collisions with other objects",
      "Gripper fully releases the bottle",

    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If contact not detected: reattempt lowering with the same limits",
      "If release fails: retry gripper open",
      "If placement area obstructed: choose a nearby clear spot and repeat",
      "If object shifts during release: gently re-seat with another brief contact-lowering"
    ],
