  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulator must pick a maroon square block located near the table center. The scene includes several distractor objects (blue can, clear cup, green bottle, orange cylinders, and a red can). The robot should first localize the maroon square, open the gripper, move above it, align with tight tolerance, grasp using a standard top strategy, and raise the object. No placement is requested; the goal is to achieve a secure lift showing object-in-gripper stability.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is homed and reachable workspace covers the table center", "Gripper operational and free of objects", "Maroon square is on the tabletop and not occluded", "Perception pipeline available to detect 'maroon_square'"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect maroon_square (retry up to 3 attempts)", "Open gripper", "Move to a safe height above the target", "Approach and align with small tolerance", "Execute top grasp", "Verify grasp stability", "Raise the held object"],
    "success_criteria": ["Maroon square lifted clear of the surface", "IsGraspStable returns success", "Object visually present in gripper after lift"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails: retry perception", "If alignment times out: reattempt approach", "If grasp fails: reopen gripper and repeat pick sequence"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the object is lifted and grasp stability is confirmed."
