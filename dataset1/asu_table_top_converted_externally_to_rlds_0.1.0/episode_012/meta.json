    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows several small objects (colored bottles/cans and a red block) within reach of a 6-DoF manipulator. The goal is to pick the red cube-like block. The robot must perceive the target, approach from above, compute a viable grasp pose, execute a pinch grasp, confirm the object is secured, lift it a short distance to clear the surface, and retreat slightly to a safe pose. No placement is requested; emphasis is on reliable perception, collision-free approach, and a stable grasp.",
