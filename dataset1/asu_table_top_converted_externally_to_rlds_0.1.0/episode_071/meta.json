  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a parallel gripper must locate a Pepsi can among several bottles, cups, and small containers on a white tabletop and perform a simple relocation. The behavior opens the gripper, perceives and aligns to the can, computes a pinch grasp, lifts slightly, moves above a safe place spot, places the can down with light force, opens the gripper to release, and retreats. No destination is specified in text, so a nominal table placement pose is used. The sequence assumes clear line of sight and unobstructed approach around the right side of the scene.",

    "success_criteria": ["Pepsi can ends at the designated table pose within small positional error", "Gripper releases fully with no residual contact", "Robot reaches a clear post-place retreat position"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, re-detect or scan the area", "If alignment or grasp fails, reopen gripper and retry compute-and-grasp", "If placement contact is early, raise and reattempt placement at the same pose", "If object slips, stop and re-detect before regrasping"],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful place, gripper open, and retreat completed."
