    "overview": "A 6-DOF robotic arm operates over a white tabletop scattered with small objects (bottles, cups, can). The instruction is to place down the blue bottle. From the frames, the gripper hovers above the center region and descends, consistent with a placing maneuver. We assume the blue bottle is already held in the gripper. The behavior moves above a chosen place zone, lowers until contact with the table, opens the gripper to release, retreats, and pauses briefly to stabilize.",

      "Open the gripper to release the blue bottle.",
      "Retreat vertically to avoid collisions.",
      "Wait shortly to ensure object settles."

      "Blue bottle released on the tabletop without toppling",

      "If contact not detected: re-approach and attempt lowering again.",
      "If release fails: re-open gripper and retry after slight retreat.",
      "If placement unstable: retreat, re-approach, and repeat with smaller descent."
    ],
    "termination": "Behavior ends after retreat and brief wait once the bottle is released."
