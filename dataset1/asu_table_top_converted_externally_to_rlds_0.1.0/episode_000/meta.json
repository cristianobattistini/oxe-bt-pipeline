  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style robotic arm operates over a semi-circular tabletop populated with small bottles, cups, and cylinders under static lighting, with the objective to pick the green bottle visible near the table center-left area. [web:3] The behavior emphasizes reliable perception and alignment before executing a side grasp suited to cylindrical bottle geometry. [web:3] Dataset episodes are structured in an RLDS-like format, so perception-first and verification steps align with standardized sequential decision data conventions. [web:6] The plan finishes after lifting to a safe height and verifying that the object remains in the gripper. [web:6]",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear of collisions above the target by at least 5 cm to allow a vertical pre-grasp approach. [web:3]",
      "Gripper is open and calibrated with known jaw width prior to perception. [web:6]",
      "Camera viewpoints provide unobstructed sight of the green bottle for detection or a short scan routine. [web:3]",
      "Controller is configured for position control suitable for approach, alignment, and lifting actions. [web:6]"
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Open the gripper to a nominal width and detect the green bottle; if immediate detection fails, run a short spiral scan. [web:6]",
      "Move above the detected bottle with a 5 cm vertical offset and align the end effector laterally to the bottle’s axis. [web:3]",
      "Compute a side grasp pose and execute the grasp at the computed pose with a moderate closing force. [web:3]",
      "Lift the bottle by 10 cm to clear the tabletop and check that it remains securely held. [web:6]"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Bottle is grasped without displacing surrounding objects. [web:3]",
      "Object remains in gripper after a 10 cm lift above the surface. [web:6]",
      "No timeouts or unrecovered perception failures occur during the sequence. [web:6]"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If DetectObject fails, the Fallback triggers ScanForTarget with a spiral pattern for up to three attempts before aborting. [web:6]",
      "If grasp slips (ObjectInGripper false), the sequence fails and can be re-executed from perception with an adjusted approach. [web:3]",
      "If alignment times out, retreat to above-target and retry alignment once after scan completes. [web:6]"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate when the bottle is lifted 10 cm and ObjectInGripper confirms possession, or on unrecoverable detection/grasp errors. [web:6]"
