  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator with a parallel gripper operates on a cluttered tabletop containing a green glass bottle plus cans and blocks. The goal is to put the glass bottle down on the table. The robot first perceives the target, aligns for a side pinch, executes a grasp, lifts slightly to clear, then moves to a free spot on the table and places the bottle before opening the gripper and retreating. The sequence prioritizes reliable perception, stable grasping, and gentle placement among nearby objects.",

      "Raise the held bottle slightly.",
      "Place on table surface with moderate yaw.",
      "Open gripper to release and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": ["Bottle rests on the table without slipping or collisions", "Gripper fully releases the bottle", "End-effector retreats clear of the object and neighbors"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Detection failure → rescan scene", "Unstable grasp → reopen and recompute grasp pose", "Contact during placement → adjust position and retry", "Bottle slips after release → regrasp if safe"],
    "termination": "Behavior ends after successful release and a short retreat from the placed bottle."
