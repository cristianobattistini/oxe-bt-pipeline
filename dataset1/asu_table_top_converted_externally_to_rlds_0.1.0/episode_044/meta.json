  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator appears over a cluttered tabletop with several small bottles/cans and a central translucent cup. The instruction is to place down a milk_box that is presumed to already be in the gripper. The robot should position above the table, descend until surface contact, open the gripper to release the box, and then back off safely. Movements should avoid nearby objects and keep approach vertical to minimize collisions.",
    "preconditions": ["milk_box is currently grasped", "tabletop is clear enough at target spot", "gripper is operational", "perception provides a safe placing area"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Verify object is held", "Move above target placing area on table", "Lower slowly until gentle contact with surface", "Open gripper to release milk_box", "Retreat vertically to a safe height"],
    "success_criteria": ["milk_box rests stably on the table", "no collisions with neighboring items", "gripper fully releases object", "end-effector retreats to safe clearance"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If contact not detected within expected depth, slightly reposition and retry lowering", "If object sticks after opening, perform a small vertical jiggle and re-open", "If area obstructed, select nearby clear spot and repeat"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the milk_box is released on the table and the arm is in a safe retreat pose."
