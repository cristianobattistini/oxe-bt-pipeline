  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator with a parallel gripper must pick a red object from a cluttered tabletop containing cans, bottles, a white carton, and other items. The contact sheet shows the arm moving from a central home pose toward the right side where a small red block sits next to a taller red bottle. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, precise alignment, and a top/pinch grasp followed by a short lift to confirm acquisition.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot and camera are calibrated to the table frame", "Workspace is free of obstacles beyond the shown items", "Gripper is functional and empty", "Red object is visible on the table"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect the red object", "Move to a safe pre-grasp height above it", "Approach and align precisely", "Open gripper to planned width", "Compute a pinch grasp pose", "Execute the grasp at the computed pose", "Close gripper with moderate force", "Verify object is in gripper", "Lift the object slightly to secure"],
    "success_criteria": ["Object detected as red_object", "Object securely held (no slip) after closing", "Lifted by ~10 cm without collision"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, re-detect or scan", "If alignment times out, retreat and re-approach", "If grasp unstable, reopen and retry with adjusted pose"],
    "termination": "Terminate once the object is detected in the gripper and lifted to the target distance."
