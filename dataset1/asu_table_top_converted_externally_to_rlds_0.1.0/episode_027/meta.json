    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates over a small white table containing several items: a blue can, an orange bottle, a red rectangular block (the target), a purple can, a translucent cup, and a green bottle. The instruction is to move the red object without grasping it. The robot should perceive the target, approach and align its end-effector, verify visibility/alignment, execute a controlled push to translate the block toward a new location, briefly stabilize, and retreat to a safe height. The action is constrained to table-top contact and must avoid disturbing nearby objects.",
