  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene contains multiple small objects (bottles, cans, and a red cube). The robot arm must ensure it is holding the red cube, move above a safe placement area on the table, lower until contact, release the cube gently, and retreat. If the cube is not already in the gripper, the robot should quickly align and grasp it first, then proceed to place. Timing and forces are kept moderate to avoid knocking nearby items.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot and table are clear of obstacles along approach path", "Red cube is detectable in the camera view", "Gripper operational"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Perceive the red cube", "If not already holding it: open gripper, approach and align, close gripper, verify stable grasp", "Move above the table placement area", "Lower until contact is detected", "Open gripper to release", "Retreat and pause"],
    "success_criteria": ["Red cube rests stably on table", "No nearby objects displaced", "Robot ends in a safe, non-contact pose"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, retry perception", "If grasp unstable, reopen and regrasp", "If contact not detected within depth limit, retreat and reattempt placement"],
    "termination": "Terminate after releasing the cube and completing a short wait following retreat."
