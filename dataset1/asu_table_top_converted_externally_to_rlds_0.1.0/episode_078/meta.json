  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates on a white table with several objects: a tall white milk carton near the table center-left, bottles and cans arranged across the surface. The goal is to push the milk carton across the tabletop without grasping it. The robot must first visually confirm the target, approach and align to a side face, perform a straight push for a set distance, and then retreat to clear any contact. Movements occur above the table plane with conservative timeouts.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot powered and homed", "Workspace free of human intrusion", "Milk carton present and reachable on the table", "Gripper open and above table surface", "Perception running"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect milk_carton", "Approach and align to a pushable face with tight tolerance", "Execute a 0.20 m push at 90° direction", "Retreat 0.10 m to clear object", "Wait briefly to stabilize"],
    "success_criteria": ["Milk carton is visibly displaced along table by approximately the commanded distance", "No unintended collisions with other objects", "End-effector ends clear of the object"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, reattempt detection or perform a broader scan", "If alignment drifts, re-align before pushing", "If push stalls due to collision, retreat and try a shallower approach"],
    "termination": "Terminate once retreat and stabilization wait complete after the push."
