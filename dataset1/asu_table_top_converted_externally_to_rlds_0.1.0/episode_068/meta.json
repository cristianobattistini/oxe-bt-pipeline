    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator interacts with tabletop items: a green glass bottle, red bottle, blue can, orange cups, a clear cup, and a small can. The goal is to put down the green glass bottle onto the table in a stable upright pose. The robot approaches a table placement area, performs a gentle press to ensure contact, opens the gripper to release, and retreats to avoid collisions. Motions should be deliberate, low force, and time-bounded.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is already holding the green glass bottle", "Table surface is clear at the intended spot", "Gripper and force sensing operational"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Verify the bottle is in the gripper", "Move above a safe placement point on the table", "Lower and gently press the bottle onto the surface", "Open the gripper to release", "Retreat to a safe distance"],
    "success_criteria": ["Bottle rests stably on the table", "No collisions with nearby objects", "Gripper fully releases the bottle", "End-effector retreats clear of objects"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If contact not detected or placement unstable, retry moving above the spot and re-place with lower force", "If release fails, reopen gripper and wiggle minimally", "If occlusions occur, adjust approach height and reattempt"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the robot has released the bottle and retreated, with the bottle upright on the table."
