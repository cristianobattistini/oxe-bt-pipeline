  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A stationary manipulator works over a white tabletop with multiple objects (brown/orange item, blue can, green bottle, red bottle). The goal is to ensure the brown object is placed down on the table. If the object is not already held, the robot detects it, computes a top grasp, grasps securely, and verifies stability. It then moves above the table, lowers until contact, performs a gentle placement on the table, opens the gripper to release, and finally retreats to clear the workspace.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot has reach to the tabletop area", "Perception available for the brown object", "Table surface free at target zone", "Gripper operational"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["If object not in gripper, detect and pick using a top grasp", "Move above the table place zone", "Lower until contact feedback", "Place onto table and release", "Retreat to a safe height"],
    "success_criteria": ["Brown object released on table surface", "No collisions with other items", "Grasp verified before transfer", "End-effector clear of objects after release"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception miss → re-detect object", "Grasp slip → regrasp with same strategy", "Early contact while lowering → abort descent and retry placement", "Occlusion by other items → adjust approach and retry"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the object is released and the arm has retreated from the placement area."
