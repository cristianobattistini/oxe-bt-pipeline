  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A table-top robot arm must push a maroon square-like block along the table surface without picking it up. The contact sheet shows the end-effector approaching from above-left, aligning to a side face, establishing contact, performing a lateral push, and then retreating. The plan prioritizes reliable perception, precise alignment, a controlled push distance and direction, and a brief stabilize wait after motion. The environment includes bottles, cans, and cups that must not be disturbed while pushing the target.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Target object 'maroon_square' is visible and within reachable workspace",
      "Table surface is clear along the intended rightward path (~0 deg)",
      "Gripper/tcp is free of any held object and in operational state"
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Perceive and localize 'maroon_square' with retries",
      "Move above target, then approach and align with tight tolerance",
      "Set tool yaw for side-surface push and verify visibility",
      "Execute push: distance 0.15 m at 0 deg direction with timeout",
      "Retreat 0.10 m and briefly wait to settle"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Maroon block translates laterally by at least 0.12–0.15 m to the right",
      "Object remains upright and within table bounds",
      "No collisions with neighboring bottles, cans, or cups",
      "Robot completes retreat and wait without faults"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Perception failure or occlusion: retry detection up to 3 attempts",
      "Small misalignment: re-run approach-and-align step",
      "High friction or minor slip: push times out; system can reattempt from align step",
      "Unexpected contact: retreat then re-approach"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after completing the retreat and wait following a successful push or after unrecoverable failure."
