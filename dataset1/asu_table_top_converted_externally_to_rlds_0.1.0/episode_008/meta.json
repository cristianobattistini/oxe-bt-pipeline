    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator operates over a curved white tabletop with several objects: cans, bottles, a cup, and a small brown bread-like item on the left. The goal is to raise the bread from the surface. The robot must detect the bread, compute a top grasp, approach and align, execute the grasp, verify stability, and lift the held item to a safe height, holding it momentarily. Constraints include gentle timing bins, discrete port values, and reliability under slight perception noise.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is homed with a functional gripper",
      "Bread object is on the table and reachable",

      "Verify pose availability, then execute grasp at the stored pose.",
      "Close the gripper and check grasp stability.",
      "Raise the held bread by a discrete upward distance and hold briefly."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Bread is securely in the gripper",

      "Lift blocked: retreat slightly and retry lift"
