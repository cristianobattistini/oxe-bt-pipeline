  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm operates over a white tabletop with several small items. The target is a white rectangular milk box placed near the center-right among bottles and cans. The behavior first detects the carton, aligns the end-effector, opens the gripper to avoid grasping, and executes a controlled surface push to translate the box laterally. After the motion, the robot pauses briefly and retreats to clear the scene. The frames suggest a push-based translation rather than a lift-and-place.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is free of obstacles along the planned push path",
      "Milk box is on a flat, pushable surface",

      "Push the milk box a short distance along the table",
      "Wait briefly for stabilization",
      "Retreat the end-effector from the object"

      "Milk box translated by roughly the commanded push distance",

      "Unexpected contact -> stop, retreat, and re-approach"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate once the retreat completes after a successful push or after a recoverable failure times out."
