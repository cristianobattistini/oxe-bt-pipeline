    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows several small containers and bottles with a UR-style arm above a white curved table. The goal is to push the red rectangular object away from its initial cluster toward the table’s near edge, consistent with the visible motion across frames. The behavior prioritizes visual confirmation, precise approach, a single straight push, and a brief retreat to clear the object. No grasping is required; the gripper remains passive and the tool face is used to impart motion. Timeouts and distances are modest to match the short slide on a smooth table.",
