  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator must move a maroon square/rectangular block resting on a tabletop by executing a controlled push. The sequence begins with perception to localize the target, followed by a safe approach above the object and fine alignment near its side. The end-effector then performs a planar push to translate the block laterally to a new location visible in later frames. After motion, the robot retreats to a safe height and pauses briefly. The operation assumes clear line of sight and no need to grasp the block.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot initialized with free workspace above table", "Maroon square block visible on tabletop", "Gripper/tcp configured for pushing contact", "No obstacles in intended push direction"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect or scan for the maroon_square", "MoveAbove to pre-push height", "ApproachAndAlign with tight tolerance near object side", "Push the block a set distance in the intended direction", "Retreat to a safe distance and wait"],
    "success_criteria": ["Block position noticeably changed from its initial pose", "No collisions with neighboring objects during push", "Robot returns to a safe, non-contact pose"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detect fails, retry and then scan in a spiral pattern", "If alignment is off, re-run ApproachAndAlign due to sequence structure", "If push stalls, task can be re-invoked or distance reduced in a new run"],
    "termination": "Terminate after completing the retreat and wait following a successful push."
