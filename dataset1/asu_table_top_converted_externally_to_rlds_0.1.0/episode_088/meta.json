    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator interacts with several small tabletop objects (green bottle, blue can, clear cup, orange toy coil, and a maroon rectangular block). The instruction is to put down the maroon object. In the frames, the gripper already holds the maroon block and moves toward the right-side open surface, lowers, releases, and backs away. The behavior emphasizes safe contact with the table, a gentle release, and a short retreat to clear the object while avoiding nearby items.",

      "Robot is homed and operational",
