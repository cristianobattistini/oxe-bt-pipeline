  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-type robotic arm operates over a white tabletop with several small containers (red can, blue bottle, orange/yellow cans, green bottle, clear cup). The goal is to raise the blue bottle from the table surface. The robot must perceive the target, approach with alignment tolerance, compute a grasp, close the gripper securely, and lift the object slightly while maintaining stability. No placement is required; the motion ends after a brief hold above the surface.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Blue bottle is on the tabletop within reachable workspace",
      "Gripper is functional and can open to at least 0.08 m",
      "Scene lighting adequate for detection",
      "Workspace free of unexpected obstacles above the object"
    ],

      "Detect the blue bottle and open the gripper.",
      "Approach and align to meet grasp tolerance.",
      "Compute grasp pose and verify it is available.",
      "Execute grasp, close gripper, and confirm stability.",
      "Raise the held bottle by 0.10 m and hold briefly."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Object is in the gripper (stable) and lifted off the table",
      "Vertical displacement of approximately 0.10 m achieved",
      "No collisions with neighboring objects"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Detection failure → re-run detection and re-approach",
      "Grasp slip → reopen, re-align, recompute grasp, and retry",
      "Lift blocked by collision → retreat slightly and retry raise"
    ],
    "termination": "End after the object is raised and held for the specified duration without loss of grasp."
