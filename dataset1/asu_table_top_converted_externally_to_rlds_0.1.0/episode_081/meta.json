    "overview": "A table-top arm must pick and hold a white box. The scene shows several small objects (orange blocks, a pink prism, green bottle, small can) arranged on a white table under a UR-style manipulator. The goal is not to move or place the object, but to establish a reliable grasp and maintain the hold briefly. The plan uses perception, alignment, a top grasp, and a stability check before holding for a fixed time.",
