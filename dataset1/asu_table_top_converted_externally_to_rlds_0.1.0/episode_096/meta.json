  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows multiple small objects on a white table and a robot arm centered over a maroon cube. The goal is to release the maroon cube onto the table in a controlled manner. The robot should start with the cube already grasped, approach the chosen place zone at the table center, align, lower until contact is detected, open the gripper to release, and then retreat to clear the object. No special precision or speed constraints are stated beyond a standard, careful placement.",

      "Open gripper to release the cube.",
      "Retreat to a safe distance from the placed cube."

      "If cube tips during release: re-grasp and attempt again with reduced speed."
