  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows multiple small objects (green bottle, red carton, two orange cups, a transparent box, a red can, and a blue can). A 6-DOF arm with a parallel gripper approaches the blue item near the table’s right side. The behavior focuses on perceiving the blue target, aligning, performing a side pick suitable for cylindrical items, confirming that it is in the gripper, and then holding it for a few seconds without placing it elsewhere.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is powered, homed, and above the workspace.",

      "Execute a side pick suitable for a small cylinder.",
      "Verify the object is in the gripper.",
      "Hold the object in the air for a short duration."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Robot cleanly grasps the correct blue object.",

      "Hold duration is completed without collisions."

      "If detection fails, re-detect from a slightly different vantage.",
      "If grasp fails, retreat, re-align, and retry with the same or alternate grasp key (e.g., std_top).",
      "If slippage occurs during hold, re-close gripper and stabilize."
    ],
