  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator must pick up a white carton placed among several distractor objects on a curved tabletop. The robot first perceives the target, then aligns its tool center point above it, computes a top grasp, executes the grasp, verifies retention, and lifts the object to clear the surface. Motions are conservative to avoid collisions with adjacent bottles and cans. Success is defined by a stable grasp and a short upward transfer.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is powered and homed", "Workspace is unobstructed within the arm’s reachable area", "White carton is visible to the camera", "Gripper operational and empty"],

      "Compute a top grasp pose.",
      "Execute grasp at computed pose and close the gripper.",
      "Verify object retention and lift.",
      "Retreat slightly to clear nearby objects."
    ],
    "success_criteria": ["Object detected and localized", "Gripper closes on the carton without collision", "ObjectInGripper condition is true", "Object is raised at least 0.10 m above the table"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception failure → re-detect and re-approach", "Misalignment or slip → reopen, re-plan grasp, and retry", "Collision risk → retreat, re-approach with adjusted alignment"],
    "termination": "Tree terminates when the carton is securely in the gripper and raised, or when any action returns failure without recovery."
