    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator interacts with several tabletop objects (red square block on the right, green bottle, soda can, orange figurine, and a clear cube). The goal is to grasp the red square and place it down on the table. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, stable grasping, gentle placement with minimal force, and a short retreat for clearance after release.",

      "Robot is homed and within reach of the red square.",

      "If detection fails, reattempt perception.",
