  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A robot arm must locate, approach, and pick up a red cylinder resting on a black table. The surrounding workspace contains blue markers, possibly for localization. The red object is clearly visible, stationary, and positioned free of occlusions. The arm executes perception, approach, grasp synthesis, and manipulation—using a top strategy to lift the object. Accuracy and object stability are prioritized.",
    "preconditions": [
      "The red cylinder is present and at rest on the table within the arm's workspace.",
      "The gripper is empty and operational.",
      "Sufficient workspace clearance exists to actuate the arm."

      "Open the gripper to the appropriate width.",

      "Compute a top-down grasp pose.",
      "Approach and align to the grasp pose with tight tolerance.",
      "Command the gripper to grasp at the computed pose.",
      "Verify the object is securely held."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "The red object is firmly held by the gripper after the process.",

    "termination": "Task ends when the robot confirms the red object is held in the gripper or upon repeated failures to acquire it."
