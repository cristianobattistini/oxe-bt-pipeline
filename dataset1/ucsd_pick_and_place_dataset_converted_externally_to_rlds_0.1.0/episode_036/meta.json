  "task_summary": "The robot must pick up the red object placed on the table using its gripper, following a structured sequence of perception, alignment, grasp, and lift.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a robotic arm equipped with a parallel-jaw gripper, performing a pick-up task of a brightly colored red cubic object situated on a blue-marked area of a table. The robot begins with perception to locate the object, approaches from above, verifies its position, gently grasps the object, and lifts it clear of the surface. No visible obstacles are present, and the blue tape markers provide consistent reference for both robot and observer. Environment lighting and object pose remain stable through the episode. The system must avoid knocking over or misaligning the object and ensure a secure grasp before lifting.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Red object is present on the table and unobstructed",
      "Robot gripper is open and ready",

      "Move above the red object at a safe offset",
      "Approach and align to the object's center",
      "Lower gradually until contact is detected",
      "Close gripper to grasp object gently",
      "Verify object is securely held",
      "Lift the object upwards"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Red object securely held in gripper",
      "No significant object displacement on table before grasp",
      "Object lifted clear from contact with table"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Failure to detect object — retry up to 3 times",
      "Unstable or missed grasp — repeat alignment/grasp steps",
      "Contact not detected — limit lowering depth and abort if necessary"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate when the red object is confirmed in gripper and elevated above table by at least 5 cm."
