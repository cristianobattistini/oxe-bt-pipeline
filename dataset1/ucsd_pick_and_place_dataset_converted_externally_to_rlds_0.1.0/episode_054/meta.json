  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this task, a robotic arm is instructed to locate a blue pot, grasp it from the countertop, and place it into the adjacent sink. The robot relies on perception nodes to identify both the pot and the sink, computes an overhead grasp, and transfers the pot with collision-free movements. Stability of the grasp is verified before transport, and placement includes alignment and gentle release. Phases visible in frames depict a human initiating, robot grasping, transferring, and placing the pot in the sink.",
