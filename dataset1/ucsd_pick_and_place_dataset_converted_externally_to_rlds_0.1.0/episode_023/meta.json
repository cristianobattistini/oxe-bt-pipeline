    "overview": "In this sequence, a robotic arm locates and grasps a red cylindrical object placed on a black tabletop, as visible in the contact sheet frames. The robot must first perceive and identify the red object, maneuver its gripper above and in alignment, execute a controlled approach until contact is detected, firmly close the gripper to grasp the object, verify the object is held, and retreat from the table. The process ensures accurate localization, gentle grasp, and successful pickup.",
