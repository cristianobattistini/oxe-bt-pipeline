  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, a robot arm is tasked with picking up a red cylindrical object that is placed on a flat black table alongside blue rectangular objects (distractors or other targets). The robot must perceive the location of the red object, approach from above, compute a suitable grasp pose, align precisely to the grasp, and close its gripper to acquire the object securely. The process involves checks and retries for perception and verifies successful pick via gripper feedback. The environment is uncluttered, allowing for clear visual detection and unobstructed access.",
