  "task_summary": "Sequence for a robot arm to pick up a pot from a stove and place it in a sink, with visual and contact feedback.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The task involves a robot arm that identifies a pot on the stove, securely grasps it using a top grasp, and transfers it to the sink, executing precise placement based on visual markers. The robot verifies the pot’s visibility and position, aligns for grasp, checks for grasp stability, moves over the sink, and releases the pot. Scene consists of small household kitchen, robotic arm, pot, and sink. Constraints include robust perception in a cluttered scene, stable object handling, and explicit placement into the sink.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot is present on the stove.",
      "Sink is empty and accessible.",
      "Gripper is clear.",

      "Retreat from sink.",
      "Wait briefly to confirm release."

    "success_criteria": [
      "Pot ends up physically inside the sink.",
      "Gripper releases pot after placement.",
      "No collision or drop during transfer.",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Object not detected: retry acquisition up to 3 times.",
