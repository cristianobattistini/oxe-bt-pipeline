  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A manipulator arm is tasked to pick up a single red cylindrical object from a table surface. The environment has additional blue markers/objects but the target is clearly distinct. The main steps are perception, approach, grasp planning, gentle approach, grasp execution, and confirmation. No explicit placement is required. The arm starts away from the target and proceeds sequentially with vision-driven behavior. The main constraint is safe, reliable grasp without collisions.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Red object is present and separated on the table.",
      "Robot's gripper is empty and open.",
      "No obstructions in arm's workspace.",

      "Visually search for the red object; retry scan up to 3 times if not seen.",

      "Plan and compute a top grasp pose.",
      "Approach and align to the grasp pose with tight tolerance.",

      "Close gripper with gentle force.",
      "Verify if object is held with the gripper (confirmation step)."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [

      "If object cannot be detected, rescan up to 3 times.",
