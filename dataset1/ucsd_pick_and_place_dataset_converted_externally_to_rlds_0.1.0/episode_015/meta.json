  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode tasks a robot arm with locating, approaching, and grasping a red block positioned on a table. The robot uses perception (object recognition), approaches from above, aligns, executes a top grasp of the block, and confirms that the object is held. The control sequence, grounded in the observed 9 frames, ends with the red block securely lifted from the table. Constraints include precise alignment and gentle initial force to avoid disturbing other objects.",
