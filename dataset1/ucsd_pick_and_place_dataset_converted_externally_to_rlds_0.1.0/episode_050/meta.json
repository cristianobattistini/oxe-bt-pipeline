  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode tasks a robot arm with picking up a red, block-shaped object from a dark table surface. The scene contains one red block and several blue objects serving as distractors. The robot must first locate the red block visually, approach it from above, align and lower for stable grasp, then close its gripper to secure the object and finally lift it off the table. Constraints include precise localization and grasp stability, with quick acquisition and minimal retries.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Red block is present and isolated on the table",
