    "overview": "This sequence describes a robotic manipulator assigned to pick up a red object from a table in an uncluttered, static scene. The arm executes visual search and confirmation, approaches from above, opens the gripper, aligns with the red object, and performs a controlled grasp followed by a lifting motion. The red object and table are the primary elements. The process is cautious: vision checks, repeat attempts if needed, and confirmation of grasp before lifting.",
