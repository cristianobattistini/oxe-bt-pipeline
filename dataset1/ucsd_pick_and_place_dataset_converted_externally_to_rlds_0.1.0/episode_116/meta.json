  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a robot arm performing a pick operation on a red block located on a black table, as observed in the contact-sheet sequence. The scene includes a visible gripper, a red cylindrical/block object, and blue markers. The primary objective is to locate, approach, grasp, and lift the red block from the table. The robot follows a sensible order: searching for the object, opening the gripper, aligning and lowering, making contact, grasping, and lifting. Accurate perception and gentle force are important to avoid object slippage.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Red block is initially on the table surface",

      "Lower until contact with appropriate force threshold",
      "Close gripper to grasp the red block",
