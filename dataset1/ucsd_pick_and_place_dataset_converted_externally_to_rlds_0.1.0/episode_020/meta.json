    "overview": "This episode features a table-top scene with three colored objects (red, blue rectangular, blue irregular) and a robotic manipulator. The robot must locate, approach, and grasp the red object, then safely lift and retreat, as required by the instruction. Accurate perception and precise positioning are essential, while avoiding collisions with other objects. The gripper is opened before grasp, and closed with sufficient but not excessive force.",
