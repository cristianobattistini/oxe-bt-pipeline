  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The robot arm operates within a compact kitchen mockup, aiming to transfer a visible blue pot from the counter surface into the sink. The workspace includes a stovetop, sink, and cabinetry, with the pot placed near the sink. The robot must locate the pot, grasp it using a side strategy, move above the sink, and release the pot onto the sink surface. Visual detection and stable grasping are prerequisites; failures require rescan attempts. The system prioritizes object-centric manipulation with safety and gentle contact force.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot is present and visually discernible on the counter.",
      "Sink is accessible and unoccluded.",
      "Gripper is initially open and the robot is operational.",

      "Confirm grasp stability.",
      "Locate sink and ensure it is visible.",
      "Move above sink and align for placement.",
      "Place pot on sink surface and open gripper.",
      "Retreat and wait briefly to confirm stability."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Pot is stably placed in the sink area.",
      "No collision or object drop occurs.",
      "Gripper releases pot above sink.",
      "All steps complete without error or timeout."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If pot not found, retry scan (up to 3 attempts).",
      "If grasp fails, repeat approach and regrasp.",
      "If sink occluded, perform detection again.",
      "Abort if critical errors or persistent visibility failures."
