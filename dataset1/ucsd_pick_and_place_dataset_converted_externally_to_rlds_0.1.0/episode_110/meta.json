    "overview": "A robotic arm is tasked with perceiving, approaching, and securely grasping a red block positioned on a table. The sequence starts with detecting the object, aligning the end-effector above it, delicately closing the gripper, and retreating after grasping. The workspace contains the red block and blue markers, which may define regions or calibration, but only the red block is targeted in this episode. Precision and clear phase transitions are prioritized to minimize errors.",
