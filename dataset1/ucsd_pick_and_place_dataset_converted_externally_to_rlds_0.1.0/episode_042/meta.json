  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a tabletop workspace with a robot arm. The arm is tasked to pick up a blue pot from its initial position near the stove and transfer it stably into the sink basin, following the task instruction. Frames document stepwise progress: initial perception, grasp planning, grasp execution, transfer trajectory, and final release. The main workspace objects are the pot, sink, countertop, and gripper. Key constraints include gentle handling and accurate placement, considering spatial alignments with the sink. The robot must handle visual occlusions, ensure stable grasp, and verify goal completion.",

      "Pot is present and visible near stove.",
