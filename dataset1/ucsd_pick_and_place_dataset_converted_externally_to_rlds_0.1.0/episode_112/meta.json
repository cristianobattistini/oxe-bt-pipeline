    "overview": "A robotic manipulator is tasked with identifying, approaching, grasping, and lifting a red cylindrical object from a table surface in a workspace with blue markers. The system must ensure the red object is visible or rescan, align above it, open the gripper, approach, make contact, close the gripper, verify a stable grasp, and finally lift the object. The workspace is uncluttered with a single clear red object target.",
