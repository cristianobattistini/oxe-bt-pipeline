  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode tasks a robot arm with picking up a red block that is placed on a table, surrounded by blue markers. The scene is strictly grounded in the contact sheet, which tracks the robot approaching, grasping, and lifting the block. The robot must localize the red block, position itself above it, open its gripper, compute a suitable top-down grasp pose, approach with precision, execute the grasp, verify success, and then retreat. No placement is required; constraints focus on accuracy of pick and avoidance of collisions.",
