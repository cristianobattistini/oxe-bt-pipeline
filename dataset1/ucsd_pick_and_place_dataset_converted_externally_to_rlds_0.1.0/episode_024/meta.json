  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The robot is tasked with picking up a small red cylindrical object from a black table. The scene includes various blue markers for spatial referencing. The robot begins by perceiving the table and locating the red object, aligns itself above the object, carefully grasps it from the top, verifies grasp stability, and then lifts the object from the table. The behavior is designed for reliability despite possible perception or grasp failures, using retries when needed.",
