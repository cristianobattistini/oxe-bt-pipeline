  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a robot manipulator tasked to pick up a red block from a tabletop scene, using a sensor-rich perception approach. The task involves sequential perception, approach, verification, grasping, and success checks, based on both the provided instruction and the observed contact sheet. The block is surrounded by blue markers and must be acquired stably; the task does not include a placement but terminates upon grasp verification. The robot uses contact sensing for grasp execution and retries a limited number of visual acquisition attempts.",
