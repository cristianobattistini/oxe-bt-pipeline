  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, a robot arm is tasked to locate and pick up a red object from a black tabletop. The arm proceeds by first visually detecting and confirming the presence of the object. It then opens the gripper, approaches from above with a computed grasp pose, aligns precisely over the target, lowers until contact is detected, and closes the gripper using minimal force suitable for gentle grasping. The final step checks that the object is securely held by the gripper. No placement or transfer beyond grasp is shown. The scene contains a red cylindrical object (target) and a blue dish (unused). No adversarial interference or dynamic changes are present.",
