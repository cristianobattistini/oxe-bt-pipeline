    "overview": "A robot arm equipped with a parallel gripper is tasked with picking up a red cylindrical object resting on a tabletop. The environment contains blue landmarks and is organized for visual perception. The robot must first visually locate the red object, safely approach from above, compute a stable grasp, actuate the gripper to secure the object, and lift it to signify successful pickup. Reliable perception, correct alignment, and sufficient gripper closure are required for success.",
