  "task_summary": "The robot must pick up the red object from the table surface using a sequential pick routine, reliably detecting and grasping the item according to visual and physical feedback.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode showcases a robotic arm tasked to pick up a red cylindrical object from a marked tabletop. The sequence starts with object detection and localization, involves a top-approach grasp strategy, physical contact sensing, and ends when the red object is securely held. The workspace includes blue tape markers and the red object; no other movable items are present. Visual detection is supplemented by reacquisition if required, and grasp stability is confirmed.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Red object is present and accessible on the table",

      "Red object is securely held in the robot's gripper",
