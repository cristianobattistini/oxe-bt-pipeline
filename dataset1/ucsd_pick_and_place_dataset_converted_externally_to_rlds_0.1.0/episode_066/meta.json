  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A robot arm is tasked to identify, approach, and pick up a red cylindrical block from a black tabletop surrounded by blue objects. The arm opens its gripper, moves above the red block, aligns, lowers to make contact, grasps, checks for success, and lifts the object. The process is visually segmented and robust, with retries for detection if necessary. The workspace is uncluttered except for the block and a few static blue objects, minimizing collision risk. No explicit placing action occurs within these frames.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Red block (red_block) is present and visible on the table.",
