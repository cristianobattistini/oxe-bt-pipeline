  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The episode depicts a robot arm tasked to pick up a red cubic object from a black tabletop. The table also contains blue objects (environmental distractors). The robot must reliably perceive and locate the red object, approach it from above, precisely grasp, and lift it, ensuring the object is secured in the gripper throughout. Robust visual detection and stable grasp checking are required for success.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Red object is present and visible on the table.",
      "Robot arm and gripper are operational and positioned above the workspace.",

      "Approach and align to the grasp pose with tight tolerance.",
      "Close the gripper with moderate force to secure the object.",
      "Confirm the object is in the gripper.",
      "Lift/retreat from the grasp location."

    "success_criteria": [
      "Red object is securely held in the gripper and lifted from the table.",
      "No collision with other objects during the maneuver.",
      "No loss of grasp during retreat."

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Failure to detect object triggers workspace scan up to 3 attempts.",
      "Failure to grasp object can be resolved by re-aligning and retrying.",
      "Loss of grasp detected via object presence check; recovery entails reattempt of grasp sequence."
