    "overview": "A robot arm operates on a tabletop to pick up a single red object (visibly cylindrical) from the table. The workspace contains visual markers and another static blue item. The task requires perception, approach, fine alignment, contact detection, and stable grasp before lifting the object. Constraints include ensuring the correct object is picked, robust grasp, and preventing disturbance of other objects.",
