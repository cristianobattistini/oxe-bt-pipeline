  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a fixed-arm robot within a mock kitchen scene containing a pot on the countertop and a nearby sink. The robot's role is to visually locate the pot, securely grasp it using a top strategy, and transfer it to the sink, ensuring that placement is stable and complete. Required actions include perception, grasp synthesis, approach, transfer, place, and retreat. Physical constraints involve precise navigation to avoid collisions and gentle placement to avoid damage.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot is visible and unobstructed on the countertop.",
      "Sink is empty and accessible.",

      "Verify or reacquire visual of sink.",
      "Move above sink.",
      "Place pot onto sink area using low force.",
      "Open gripper to release pot.",
      "Retreat and wait briefly."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Pot is fully inside the boundary of the sink.",
      "No collisions or dropped object during maneuver.",
      "Release is stable; gripper is empty after place."

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Perception failure: scan and retry visual reacquisition.",
      "Grasp failure: reattempt grasp sequence.",
      "Placement off-target: adjust and retry placement.",
      "Contact issues: monitor force feedback, replan if excessive resistance."
