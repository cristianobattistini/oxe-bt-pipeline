  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The robot arm is tasked to perceive, approach, and pick up a red cylindrical object from a tabletop workspace. The sequence involves detecting the object's presence, moving the gripper above it, aligning for grasp, gently closing the gripper to secure it, verifying successful grasp, and retracting to a safe position. The process uses visual feedback and retries to overcome perception failures; no placement is required. The scenario is unconstrained except for the object's color and position on a flat table.",
