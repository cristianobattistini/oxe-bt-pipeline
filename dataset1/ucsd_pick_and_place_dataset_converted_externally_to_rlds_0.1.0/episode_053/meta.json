  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A robot arm is tasked to pick up a red cylindrical object from a table. The scene includes a blue spiked ball and a purple polyhedral object, but only the red object is targeted. The robot uses perception to identify the object, approaches above it, aligns, grasps, and verifies successful pickup before lifting. The plan is defined by framewise evidence and the explicit task instruction that specifies no further placement, constraints on stability, and that the object must be securely in the gripper at the end.",
