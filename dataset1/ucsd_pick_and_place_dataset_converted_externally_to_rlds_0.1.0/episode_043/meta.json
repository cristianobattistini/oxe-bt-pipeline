    "overview": "This episode demonstrates a robot arm tasked with picking up a red object (cylinder) from a black table. The objects involved include the red cylindrical object as the target and blue rectangular objects as distractors. The robot must perceive, approach, align, and securely grasp the red object from above, finally lifting it from the table surface. The sequence must be robust to visibility uncertainty and execute grasp with sufficient accuracy to prevent slips.",
