  "task_summary": "Pick up the red object (cylinder) from the table using a top grasp.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a robotic arm identifying and picking up a red cylindrical object from a tabletop workspace. The robot first ensures the object is visible, scans if needed, then opens its gripper, moves above the object, computes a top grasp, approaches and aligns itself, lowers until contact is detected, closes the gripper to grasp, and confirms the object is securely held. The procedure relies on visual cues and force feedback for robust execution.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Red cylinder is present and accessible on the table",
      "Robot gripper is empty and functional",
      "Workspace is unobstructed",
      "Sensors (camera, force) operational"
    ],

      "Verify visibility of the red cylinder",
      "Scan workspace if the object is not visible",
      "Detect the precise pose of the red cylinder",
      "Open gripper in preparation for grasp",
      "Move above the target object",
      "Compute a suitable top grasp pose",
      "Approach and align to the grasp pose with tight tolerance",
      "Lower until gentle contact with the object is made",
      "Close the gripper to grasp the object",
      "Verify the object is held and the grasp is stable"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Red cylinder is securely grasped by the gripper",
      "Object lifts off from the table without dropping",
      "Grasp stability confirmed"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Failure to detect object: scan again up to 3 attempts",
      "Unstable grasp: retry the approach and/or close the gripper",
      "Object not grasped: abort and re-initiate the approach"
    ],
    "termination": "The behavior terminates when the red cylinder is reliably held by the gripper and grasp stability is confirmed."
