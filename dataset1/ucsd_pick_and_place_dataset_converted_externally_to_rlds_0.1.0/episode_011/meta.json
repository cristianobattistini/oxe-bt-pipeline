  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode demonstrates a robotic arm tasked with picking up a small red cylindrical object located on a table. The robot must perceive the object's location, approach and align above it, compute an appropriate grasp pose, grasp the object from above, and verify that it has been secured. The workspace contains additional colored objects, but only the red cylinder is the intended target. Accurate perception and gentle grasping are necessary due to the constrained environment and object arrangement.",
