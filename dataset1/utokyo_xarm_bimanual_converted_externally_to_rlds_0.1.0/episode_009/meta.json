  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The goal is to unfold a wrinkled towel using a bimanual robot system. The workspace includes a green mat, with the towel placed centrally and initially crumpled. The robots use perception to locate the towel, compute a grasp pose, and jointly grasp it using a top strategy. They then execute an unfolding maneuver using a pulling motion to flatten out at least two major folds. The towel is then placed down and released, leaving it unfolded and flat on the workspace. The process is sequential, guided by visibility checks, grasp stability, and the final geometric outcome.",
