  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode shows a bimanual robotic arm operating in a tabletop workspace with a pink towel placed centrally on an artificial grass mat. The robot begins away from the towel, visually searches and localizes it, approaches from above, aligns itself for contact, and moves to a position indicating successful reach. No grasp or manipulation is intended; the objective is to accurately reach and make contact with the towel using sensor feedback to confirm success.",
