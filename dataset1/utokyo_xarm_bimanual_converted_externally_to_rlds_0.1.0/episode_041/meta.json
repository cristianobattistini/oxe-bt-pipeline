    "overview": "A dual-armed robot operates in a tabletop environment with a towel spread across a green mat. The task is to reach (move the end effector above and toward) the towel. The sequence engages perception to locate the towel, then maneuvers above and aligns with the target before finishing in proximity. No grasp or manipulation is performed.",
