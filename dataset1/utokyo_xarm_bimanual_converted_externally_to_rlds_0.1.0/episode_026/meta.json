  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode shows a robotic arm tasked with reaching a towel placed flat on a surface. The arm begins above the workspace, visually locates the towel, approaches above it, aligns, and moves to make contact, stopping when it confirms proximity. The sequence demonstrates robust perception and cautious motion planning. Constraints are workspace area and precise positioning by the arm; no physical grasp is attempted.",
