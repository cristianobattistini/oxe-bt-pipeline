  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a dual-arm robot on an artificial grass table tasked to unfold a wrinkled pink towel. At the outset, arms are poised above the towel. The robot's actions, captured across 9 frames, progress from detecting the towel, computing a grasp, performing an unfold maneuver (likely a bimanual pull), and finally placing the towel flat. Key constraints include accurate perception, stable grasping, and sufficient unfolding to remove visible wrinkles.",
