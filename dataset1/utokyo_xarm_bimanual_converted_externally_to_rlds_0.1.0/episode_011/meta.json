  "task_summary": "A bimanual robot unfolds a wrinkled towel through perception, grasping, pulling, and placement, progressing from detection through to post-task retreat as seen in nine sequential frames.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, a bimanual robot is tasked to unfold a wrinkled towel placed on a green surface. The task involves several phases: the robot first detects and localizes the towel, computes a grasp for bimanual manipulation, executes a coordinated pinch grasp, and performs an unfolding maneuver using a pulling strategy to remove wrinkles. Following unfolding, the towel is placed down and the grippers are opened, with the robot retreating to end the sequence. The scene is static, focused on the towel manipulation. The main objects are the towel and the robot's grippers; the episode progresses without external disturbances or constraints other than achieving a smooth, visibly less-wrinkled towel.",
