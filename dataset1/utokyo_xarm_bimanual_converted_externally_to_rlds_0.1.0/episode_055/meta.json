  "task_summary": "The robot is instructed to reach a towel. The episode comprises a sequence in which the arm detects, approaches, and aligns with a towel on the workspace. No grasp or manipulation is observed; the sequence demonstrates a successful reaching behavior constrained to precise positioning.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode demonstrates a robotic manipulator tasked with reaching a towel laid out on a workspace. The scene centers around the robot arm, a pink towel on green matting, and no extraneous clutter. The robot employs visual detection, localization, and precise movement to fulfill the instruction. The process prioritizes perceiving and aligning, with no grasp evident from the frames. The episode focuses on positioning, with tolerance consistent with fine alignment, and includes recovery for initial perception failure.",
