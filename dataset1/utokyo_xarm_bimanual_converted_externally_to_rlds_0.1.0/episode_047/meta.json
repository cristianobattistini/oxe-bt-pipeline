  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a bimanual robot required to locate and approach a pink towel placed on a work surface. The robot attempts visual detection, retries if the towel is not visible, and then aligns and positions its end-effector above the towel, stopping at a safe offset. No grasp or manipulation occurs; the objective is to reach above the towel using precise movement. The process leverages visual perception, safe approach strategies, and brief wait verification. Constraints include workspace boundaries and non-contact approach. The scene consists of the robot, towel, green mat, and background objects.",
