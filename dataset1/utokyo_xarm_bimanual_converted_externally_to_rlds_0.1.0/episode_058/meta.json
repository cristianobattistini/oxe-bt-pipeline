    "overview": "This episode shows a bimanual robot (xArm) in a tabletop scene with a pink towel. The robot initially observes the workspace, then proceeds to detect, approach, and precisely align itself above the towel. The sequence relies on perception and spatial movement to establish proximity, with the end effector as the active agent. No manipulation (grasp or place) is performed; the goal is to reach and verify presence at the towel.",
