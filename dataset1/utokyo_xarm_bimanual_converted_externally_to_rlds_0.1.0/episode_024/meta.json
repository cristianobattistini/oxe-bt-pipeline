    "overview": "A bimanual robot manipulator is tasked to reach toward a towel positioned on a workspace. The process involves visually detecting the towel, approaching above it, aligning precisely, lowering until contact, and closing the gripper to effect a grasp. The sequence strictly follows visual evidence from the frames, with clear arm approach and attempt to grasp the towel, matching the task instruction. Pre- and post-conditions include clear workspace, grasp-ready towel, and unobstructed path.",
