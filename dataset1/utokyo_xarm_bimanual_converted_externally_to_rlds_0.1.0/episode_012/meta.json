  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode depicts a dual-arm robot performing a bimanual manipulation task to unfold a towel lying on a surface. The robot first perceives and locates the towel, aligns its end-effectors above the object, opens its grippers, grasps the towel using a top-down approach, and, coordinating its arms, executes an unfolding motion, releasing the towel once it is laid flat. The process is constrained by the need for careful perception, delicate grasping, coordinated movement, and safe release.",
