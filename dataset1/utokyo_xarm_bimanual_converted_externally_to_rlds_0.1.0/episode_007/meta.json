    "overview": "This episode documents a bimanual robot tasked with unfolding a wrinkled towel laid on a grassy work surface. Across the sequence, the robot visually locates the towel, aligns its end-effectors, plans a suitable bimanual grasp, and executes a two-step unfolding maneuver. Concluding actions include gentle placement and retreat, optimizing for full extension of the towel. The scene is constrained by workspace boundaries, tactile feedback, and arm reach.",
