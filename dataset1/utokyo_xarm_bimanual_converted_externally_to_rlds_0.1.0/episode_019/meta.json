    "overview": "This episode documents a bimanual robot (xArm) tasked to reach a towel placed onto an artificial grass mat on a table. The robots begin from rest, perceive the working space for the towel, and maneuver towards the towel's surface in a visually guided fashion, halting upon either light contact or alignment. Core constraints are visibility of the towel and accurate approach. Robustness is needed for perception and motion, but no grasp or manipulation is performed after contact.",

      "End-effector in close proximity to or touching the towel.",
