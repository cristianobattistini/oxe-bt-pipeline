    "overview": "A dual-arm robot on a workspace is tasked to unfold a wrinkled towel placed on a green mat. The system first perceives the towel, then plans a grasp, manipulates the towel by pulling at key contact points to unfold it, and finally releases and retreats. The scene must support unimpeded arm motion; the main constraint is achieving a flat unfolded towel state.",
