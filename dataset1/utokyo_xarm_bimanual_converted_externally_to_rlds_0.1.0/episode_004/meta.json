  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features two bimanual arms interacting with a pink towel on a green table surface. The robots begin by perceiving the towel's pose and wrinkles, grasp it with a pinch grasp, coordinate their movement to unfold it by pulling, and place it flat. The target is to transition the towel from a wrinkled, compact state to a visibly spread, unfolded state on the table. Precision in grasp selection and coordinated pulling are required for a successful unfold.",
