  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The episode demonstrates a bimanual robotic arm tasked with reaching a visible pink towel placed on a work surface. The robot begins from a standoff position and methodically perceives, localizes, and moves above the towel. Through careful vertical and lateral alignment, the system prepares for subsequent towel manipulation. The entire approach prioritizes perception-driven correction and positional safety, relying on vision-based reacquisition and precise movement.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear; towel is present and within reachable zone.",
      "Robot is powered and gripper is free.",

      "Approach and align to the towel within a tight positional tolerance.",
      "Wait briefly to confirm stable posture before further actions."

    "success_criteria": [
      "End-effector positioned above and aligned to the towel within tolerance.",
