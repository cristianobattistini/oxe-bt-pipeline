  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a dual-arm robotic system interacting with a workspace containing a pink towel and patches of green surface. The robot must perceive the towel, locate its position reliably, and approach it from above, aligning precisely with its surface. The sequence prioritizes towel localization and robust approach, as confirmed by multiple visual cues in the frames.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot arms are already unoccupied and in a ready position.",

      "Move above the towel, maintaining a safe offset.",
      "Approach and align with the towel with tight tolerance.",
      "Pause briefly to confirm objective."

    "success_criteria": [
      "Robot reaches the towel with end-effector aligned above the surface.",
      "No collision or unexpected contact occurs.",
