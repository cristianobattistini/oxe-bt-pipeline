  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a bimanual robot arm tasked with reaching a pink towel placed on a green field. The robot starts away from the towel and progressively moves toward it using reliable visual perception action. The main object involved is the towel, and the robot's role is to approach and visually verify its arrival at the target. The sequence proceeds with detecting the towel, approaching, and ensuring alignment for a successful reach. Constraints include limited workspace and accurate perception.",
