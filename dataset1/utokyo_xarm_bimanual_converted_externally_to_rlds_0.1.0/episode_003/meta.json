  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A dual-arm robot is tasked to reach a towel placed on a workspace. The behavior begins with object perception to locate the towel, proceeds to move above its position, and carefully aligns and approaches before verifying the reach. The process leverages vision and spatial alignment to ensure accurate arrival. No grasp or manipulation is required as per the visible episode frames and instruction.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Towel is placed on the workspace and is visually accessible.",
