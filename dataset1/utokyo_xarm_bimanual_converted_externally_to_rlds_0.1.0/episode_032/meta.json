  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In this episode, a bimanual robot is tasked with unfolding a wrinkled towel placed on a green, grass-like surface. The robot begins by detecting the towel, approaches with open grippers, computes a suitable grasp, and performs an unfolding action using a pull strategy. After the towel is extended and flattened, the robot places it down, releases the grip, and retreats, ensuring the towel is fully unfolded. The process is visually confirmed through nine contact-sheet frames showing each phase distinctly.",
