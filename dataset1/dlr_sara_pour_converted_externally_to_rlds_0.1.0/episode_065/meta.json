  "task_summary": "The robot is instructed to pour liquid from a blue bottle into a white mug using a sequence of approach, alignment, pour, and retreat actions. The behavior tree ensures robust perception, precise positioning above the mug, and a controlled pour cycle.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode involves a robotic arm, SARA, equipped with a blue bottle as a pour source. Its goal is to locate and pour into a white mug positioned on a wooden table, following the process from object detection to pour completion. The scene is structured for clarity, and actions are sequenced to avoid spillage, with attention to mug visibility and thorough approach alignment. There are no obstacles or apparent secondary objects. The mug and bottle are both visible throughout the episode.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Mug is present and reachable on the table.",
      "Bottle is securely held in the gripper with liquid for pouring.",
      "No obstructions between robot and mug."

      "Verify mug visibility (fallback to detection if needed).",
      "Move the bottle above the mug at a safe vertical offset.",
      "Approach and align with the mug for accuracy.",
      "Pour contents from the bottle into the mug at a moderate tilt.",
      "Retreat once pouring is complete."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Liquid is poured into the mug with minimal spillage.",
      "Bottle is positioned and aligned above mug before pour.",
      "Robot returns to a safe position after pouring."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If mug is not visible, retry detection.",
      "If misalignment occurs, repeat alignment.",
      "If pour fails or is interrupted, abort and retreat."
    ],
    "termination": "Task is terminated when pouring is completed and robot has safely retreated."
