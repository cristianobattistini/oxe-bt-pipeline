  "task_summary": "A robot arm identifies a cup, grasps it, approaches a mug, and pours the contents from the cup into the mug.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves a robotic arm equipped with a gripper pouring the contents of a cup into a nearby mug. The sequence proceeds in a typical laboratory or workspace environment, beginning with object localization and culminating in a controlled pour action. The workspace includes a cup, a mug, and a flat surface. Accuracy is emphasized in approach, grasp, and pouring phases, with visual verification. Constraints include avoiding spillage, ensuring the mug is correctly targeted, and maintaining object stability throughout.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cup and mug are present and accessible on the workspace.",
      "Cup contains pourable liquid or substance.",
      "No obstacles between robot and target objects.",

      "Move above the mug.",
      "Align the cup above the mug.",
      "Tilt the cup to pour into the mug.",
      "Retreat gripper after pouring."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Liquid or content is transferred from cup to mug with minimal spillage.",
      "Cup is stably grasped throughout pouring.",
      "Correct objects identified (cup and mug)."

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Failure to detect target objects triggers additional scanning attempts.",
      "Grasp failure prompts re-attempts up to retry threshold.",
      "Pour misalignment or blockage leads to retreat and possible reset."
