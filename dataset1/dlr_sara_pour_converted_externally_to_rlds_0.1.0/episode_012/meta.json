    "overview": "This episode shows a robot manipulating a bottle to pour its contents into a mug placed on a workbench. The scene involves a UR-style robotic arm, a white mug, and a bottle as the liquid source. The arm must accurately perceive and move above the mug, approach and align for pouring, perform the pour with appropriate tilting, then retreat after completion. Key constraints are accurate detection, controlled pouring, and ensuring no spillage.",
