  "task_summary": "The robot arm pours liquid from a cup into a mug, starting from an aligned pre-position, executing the pour over the mug, and retreating after completion.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a 6-DOF robot arm performing a pouring task. The arm first locates and approaches the mug on the workspace, aligns the cup above the mug, and performs a controlled pour, tilting the source cup until its contents are transferred into the mug. After pouring, the arm retreats to a safe position. The core objects are the cup (source) and mug (target). The process relies on successful visual detection, alignment, and pour actuation; timing and force are set for a typical controlled pour. No container opening is necessary, and obstacles are absent.",
