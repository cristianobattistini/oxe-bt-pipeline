  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a robot arm equipped with a gripper holding a cup, tasked with pouring its contents into a mug placed on a table. The robot visually locates the mug, approaches from above, aligns for pouring, executes a stable tilt and pour, and finally retreats. Objects in the scene include the mug, cup, and workspace. The scene is unobstructed, and the robot must tightly align before pouring, avoiding spilling outside the mug.",

      "Cup is in robot's gripper.",
