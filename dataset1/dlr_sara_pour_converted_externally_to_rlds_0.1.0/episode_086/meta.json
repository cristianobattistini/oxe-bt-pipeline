  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features a stationary robot arm equipped with a gripper holding a jug over a mug. The objective is to pour the jug's contents into the mug, following a sequence that begins with localizing the mug, approaching from above, aligning, pouring, and then retreating. The workspace is structured, with mug and jug clearly visible and unobstructed, ensuring a controlled environment for the task without other interfering objects. Pouring is achieved by tilting the jug to a suitable angle to facilitate fluid transfer.",
    "preconditions": ["Mug is present and upright on the workspace.", "Robot holds the jug.", "No major obstructions in path.", "Mug location is known or can be detected."],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Verify mug visibility.", "Move the jug above the mug.", "Align above the mug.", "Tilt the jug to pour contents.", "Retreat after pour.", "Wait to confirm completion."],
    "success_criteria": ["Mug receives poured contents.", "No significant spillage occurs.", "Jug is returned to initial or safe position.", "Robot does not collide with workspace or objects."],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Mug not detected: retry detection.", "Alignment inaccurate: repeat approach.", "Pour not initiated: retry pour action.", "Spillage detected: abort and alert."],
    "termination": "Once pouring is complete and robot has retreated, the episode ends."
