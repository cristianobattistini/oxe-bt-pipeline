    "overview": "A fixed-base 6-DoF manipulator, equipped with a gripper holding a cup, pours its contents into a mug placed on the table. The main roles are arm manipulation for precise alignment and safe pouring. Constraints include collision avoidance, correct orientation over the mug, and a controlled pour angle (tilt). Visual feedback ensures accurate positioning throughout.",
