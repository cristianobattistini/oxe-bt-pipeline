  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A robot arm equipped with a gripper holds a cup and is tasked with pouring its contents into a mug. The environment is a tabletop workspace with the mug positioned centrally and the cup grasped by the robot. The sequence involves locating the mug, moving above it, tilting the cup for pouring, returning to a neutral pose, and retreating. Actions must be coordinated to avoid collision and ensure alignment over the mug.",
