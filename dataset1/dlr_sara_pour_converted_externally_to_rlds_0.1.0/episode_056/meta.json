  "task_summary": "A robot arm pours liquid from a bottle or cup into a mug on a work table, involving perception, alignment, actuation, and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The episode demonstrates a robot arm performing a pouring task. The robot first locates both the destination mug and the source vessel (cup/bottle) through visual perception. It approaches above the source, aligns with the mug, and performs a controlled pour by tilting the source vessel. After the pour, the robot retreats to a safe distance. The process emphasizes spatial precision to avoid spillage and efficient sequencing for repeatability.",
