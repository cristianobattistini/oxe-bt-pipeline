  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode depicts a robot arm tasked with pouring the contents of a bottle into a mug placed on a wooden table. The robot visually locates the mug, approaches and aligns with its opening, tilts the bottle to pour, and then retreats. The objects are a blue-capped bottle held by the robot gripper and a white mug. Critical constraints include precise positioning, collision avoidance, and ensuring all liquid is directed into the mug.",
