  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode features an industrial robot arm equipped for object manipulation on a tabletop. The main objects are a mug and a cup (source, likely the brown vessel). The robot begins by identifying and approaching the mug, verifies visibility of both mug and cup, computes and executes a side grasp on the cup, ensures grasp stability, moves to pour position above the mug, performs a 90-degree tilt pour, and finally retreats. The main roles are perception, manipulation, and confirmatory checks for stable pouring. The visual context confirms the mug as the recipient and cup as the source.",
