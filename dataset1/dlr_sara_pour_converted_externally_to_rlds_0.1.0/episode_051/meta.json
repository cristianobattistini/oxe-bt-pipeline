  "task_summary": "The robot is tasked to pour liquid from a cup into a mug using a structured pouring maneuver, as captured in nine sequential contact sheet frames. The BT implements detection, approach, pour, and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode centers on a robotic arm executing the 'pour into the mug' task. The workspace contains a white mug on a table and a brown cup held by the robot. The robot must visually locate the mug, approach with the cup, align, and perform a controlled pour, ensuring liquid transfer. After pouring, the robot retracts the cup from above the mug. The scene is static; accuracy of mug localization and approach without spillage are key constraints.",
    "preconditions": [
      "The mug is upright and placed on the work surface.",
      "The cup is held securely by the robot gripper.",
      "Both cup and mug are within reachable workspace."

      "Detect and verify visibility of the mug.",
      "Detect and verify visibility of the cup.",

      "Confirm spatial proximity to the mug.",
      "Pour from the cup into the mug with appropriate tilt and pour rate.",
      "Retract the cup from above the mug after pouring."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Liquid successfully transferred from the cup into the mug.",
      "No significant spillage outside the mug.",
      "Cup returns to a safe distance after pouring."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If mug detection fails, retry 'DetectObject' on mug.",
      "If alignment error detected, re-approach with allowed tolerance.",
      "If pour fails (jammed or blocked), abort and retry with adjusted tilt."
    ],
    "termination": "Task terminates when pouring completes and the cup is retracted above a threshold distance from the mug."
