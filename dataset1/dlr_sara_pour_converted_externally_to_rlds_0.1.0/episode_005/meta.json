  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This episode shows an industrial manipulator tasked with pouring the contents from a cup into a mug located on a table. The robot localizes both the mug (target) and the source cup, moves above the cup, aligns precisely, confirms mug position, pours at a controlled tilt angle, and then retreats. The workspace is static with unoccluded objects and no visible dynamic obstacles.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cup contains pourable contents.",
      "Mug and cup are both visible and within reach.",
      "Workspace is clear of unexpected obstacles.",

      "Confirm proper position over mug.",
      "Pour from the cup into the mug by tilting.",
      "Retreat after completion."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Contents are poured into the mug with minimal spillage.",
      "Cup is aligned and tilted at least 45 degrees.",
      "Robot safely retreats without disturbing objects."

      "Mug or cup not detected: retry detection.",
      "Approach fails: repeat move and alignment.",
      "Pour unsuccessful: signal failure, possibly retry."
