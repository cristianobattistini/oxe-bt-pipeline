  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene with a robot arm, a small pot with a lid, a round plate area on a tan board, and a spatula tool. The robot must first uncover the pot by opening its lid, then grasp the pot and set it onto the plate area. After that, the robot switches to tool use: it grasps the spatula and pushes the pot toward the table’s front (toward the camera). Actions should be sequential and perception-led with moderate timeouts.",
