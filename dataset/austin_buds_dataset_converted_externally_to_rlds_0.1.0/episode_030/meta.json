  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a robot arm, a lidded pot on a brown board, a white plate/bowl, and a flat spatula tool. The robot must first remove the pot’s lid, then grasp and place the pot onto the plate. Finally, the robot equips the tool and performs a planar push so the pot moves toward the table’s front (bottom of frames). Motions should be gentle, with short timeouts and modest lift before placing. Visual re-detections help confirm targets before each manipulation.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and tool are present and reachable",

      "Detect and grasp the spatula-like tool.",
      "Push the pot toward the front of the table with the tool.",

      "Lid is visibly off the pot",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails, re-detect target and retry grasp.",

      "If push under-shoots, repeat push with same direction."
