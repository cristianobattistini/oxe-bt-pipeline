  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a robotic arm, a lidded pot or small bowl, a round plate, and a spatula-like tool. The robot must first remove the potâ€™s lid, then pick the pot and place it centered on the plate. After placement, the robot uses the spatula to push the pot toward the front edge of the table while maintaining contact on the surface. Movements should remain collision-aware around nearby cookware and fixtures, with measured press force during placement and controlled push distance.",
    "preconditions": ["Tabletop is clear of unexpected obstacles", "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are visible within reach", "Gripper is operational and empty", "Calibration and frame transforms are valid"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect pot, plate, and spatula", "Open gripper and remove the lid using an open action", "Compute grasp for pot, grasp it, and lift slightly", "Place pot on the plate and release", "Compute grasp for spatula, grasp it, and push the pot toward the front", "Release tool and retreat"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid is off and not covering the pot", "Pot rests on the plate without tipping", "Pot is shifted toward the front direction by the commanded distance", "End-effector is clear of objects at termination"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, re-detect targets", "If grasp fails, retry with alternative strategy (top vs side)", "If placement misaligns, re-place with small corrections", "If push stalls, adjust contact point and repeat push"],
    "termination": "Terminate after final retreat once the push has moved the pot toward the front and the gripper is empty."
