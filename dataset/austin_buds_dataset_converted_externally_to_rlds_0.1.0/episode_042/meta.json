  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene features a pot with a lid, a separate plate, a spatula-like tool, and other utensils. The robot must first open the pot by removing its lid. Next, it should grasp the pot and place it centered on the nearby plate. Finally, it needs to acquire the spatula tool and use it to push the pot toward the front side of the table, improving its accessibility. Motions should be deliberate with standard timeouts and minimal placement force.",
    "preconditions": ["Pot, lid, plate, and spatula present on the table", "Workspace clear enough to move the arm", "Perception can localize objects"],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Perceive the pot and remove its lid using an open-container primitive.",
      "Re-perceive the pot and compute a side grasp; pick the pot.",
      "Place the pot onto the plate and release; retreat.",
      "Perceive and grasp the spatula tool.",
      "Push the pot toward the table front using the spatula; set it down; open gripper and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is off the pot",
      "Pot is resting on the plate",
      "Pot has been pushed toward the front edge relative to its prior position"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If perception fails, retry detection of the relevant target",
      "If grasp fails, recompute grasp and retry",
      "If push slips, re-approach and execute another push of the remaining distance"
    ],
    "termination": "End when the push completes and the tool is released with the arm safely retreated."
