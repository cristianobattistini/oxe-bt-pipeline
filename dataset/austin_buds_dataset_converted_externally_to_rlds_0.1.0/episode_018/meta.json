    "overview": "The scene shows a tabletop with a small pot and lid on a brown stove board, a white plate on the black table area, and a spatula tool. The robot first removes the lid from the pot and sets it aside on the stove surface. Next, it grasps the pot and places it onto the plate. Finally, using the spatula as a pushing tool, the robot pushes the pot-plate assembly toward the table’s front edge, ensuring controlled motion and object stability.",
