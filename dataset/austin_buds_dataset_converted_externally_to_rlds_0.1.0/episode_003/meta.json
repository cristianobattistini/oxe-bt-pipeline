  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A robot arm operates on a tabletop with a pot that has a lid, a round plate, and a spatula tool. The goal is threefold: first, expose the pot by removing its lid; second, pick up the pot and place it centered on the plate; third, use the spatula to push the pot forward to the near edge of the table. The robot should handle objects gently, maintain alignment during placement, and push in a straight line toward the operator-facing edge.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, pot lid, plate, and spatula are visible on the table",
      "Workspace is clear enough for unobstructed arm motion",

      "Acquire the spatula with a top grasp.",
      "Align to the pot and push toward the table front."
    ],

      "Lid no longer covering the pot",

      "If lid removal slips: re-detect and retry opening.",
      "If grasp fails: recompute grasp pose and reattempt.",
      "If push deviates: realign to pot and repeat push with shorter distance."
