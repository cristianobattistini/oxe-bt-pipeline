    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene shows a robot arm, a small pot with a removable lid, a light-colored plate to the left, a spatula-like tool on the far left, and a bowl at the lower area representing the front of the table. The robot must first open the pot by removing its lid, then relocate the pot onto the plate. Finally, the robot needs to use the spatula tool to push the pot toward the front edge of the workspace, keeping motions controlled and avoiding collisions with surrounding objects.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are visible on the table",
      "Robot gripper is operational and empty at start",
      "Work surface is clear enough to allow sliding/pushing",
      "Pot fits on the plate without tipping"

      "Perceive and localize the pot, plate, and spatula",
      "Open the pot by removing its lid",
      "Grasp the pot and lift slightly",
      "Place the pot centered on the plate",
      "Pick up the spatula and align near the pot",
      "Push the pot toward the front edge of the table",
      "Set the tool down and retreat"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid removed from the pot and not blocking the path",
      "Pot placed stably on the plate",
      "Pot pushed toward the front without falling or tipping",
      "Tool released safely and arm returns to a safe pose"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Perception failure: retry detection several times",
      "Unstable grasp: re-compute grasp and retry",
      "Placement misalignment: re-align and re-place",
      "Push stalls or deviates: re-approach and repeat push"
    ],
    "termination": "Task ends when the pot rests on the plate and has been pushed toward the front, the tool is placed back, and the arm retreats to a safe distance."
