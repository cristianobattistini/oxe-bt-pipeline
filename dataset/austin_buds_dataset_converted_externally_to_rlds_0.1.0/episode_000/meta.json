  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A table-top robot manipulator interacts with a lidded pot, a round plate on the left, and a spatula tool to the left of the pot. The robot must first take off the lid, set it aside on the table, then pick up the pot and place it on the plate. Finally, it must grasp the spatula and push the pot toward the table’s front edge, corresponding to the bottom of the frames. The plan emphasizes reliable perception, stable grasps, gentle placement, and a controlled tool-mediated push.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are on the workspace and reachable",
      "Gripper and tool usage calibrated for the objects",
      "Table surface is clear enough for placing the lid and moving the pot"

      "Grasp the pot and place it onto the plate",
      "Grasp the spatula and push the pot toward the table front",
      "Retreat to a safe pose and release the tool"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is removed and rests on the table surface",
      "Pot sits on the plate without tipping",
      "Pot is pushed toward the table front by the specified distance"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If grasp fails, recompute grasp and retry with adjusted approach",
      "If placement misaligns, re-approach and re-place with lower press force",
      "If push slips, re-align with the pot and repeat the push"
    ],
    "termination": "End when the pot is on the plate and has been pushed toward the front, the tool is released, and the arm has retreated to a safe offset."
