  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A table-top scene shows a pot/bowl, its lid, a plate to the left, and a flat tool (spatula). The robot must first open the pot by removing its lid. Then it must grasp the pot, lift and move it to rest on the visible plate. Finally, it should pick up the spatula and use it to push the pot toward the front edge of the table. The behavior emphasizes simple perception, stable grasping, careful placement, and a short pushing motion with a handheld tool.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are present on the table.",
      "Robot has free workspace and reachable poses.",
      "Perception can localize lid, pot, plate, and spatula."

      "Detect lid and remove it using an open-container primitive.",
      "Detect the pot, compute a side grasp, grasp and stabilize.",

      "Detect and grasp the spatula from the top.",
      "Push the pot toward the front of the table using the spatula; release tool and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is off the pot and not re-covering it.",
      "Pot is stably resting on the plate surface.",
      "Pot has been pushed in the intended frontward direction."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If grasp fails, recompute grasp pose and retry.",
      "If placement contact is unstable, re-place with lower press force.",
      "If push direction is incorrect, reorient and repeat push."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after the pot is on the plate and displaced toward the table front, with the robot safely retreated."
