    "overview": "A table-top scene includes a small pot with a lid, a plate, a spatula tool, and a cooktop board. The robot must first uncover the pot by removing its lid. Next, it must grasp the pot and place it centered on the plate. Finally, using the spatula as a pushing tool, the robot should slide the pot forward toward the table’s near edge while keeping contact stable and avoiding collisions with nearby objects.",
