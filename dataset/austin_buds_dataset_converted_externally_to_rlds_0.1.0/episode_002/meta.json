  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulator interacts with kitchen items: a pot with a lid, a round plate, and a spatula-like tool. The robot must first take the lid off the pot. Next, it must grasp the pot and place it centered on the plate. Finally, using the tool, it pushes the pot toward the tableâ€™s front edge. The behavior emphasizes robust perception, stable grasping, controlled placement on the plate, and a deliberate push using a tool with alignment to avoid tipping or sliding off undesirably.",
