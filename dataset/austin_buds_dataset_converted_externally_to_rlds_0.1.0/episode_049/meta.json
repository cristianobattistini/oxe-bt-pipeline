  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a small pot with a lid, a round plate, and a spatula-like tool. The robot must first remove the pot’s lid, then grasp the pot and place it onto the plate. After releasing the pot, the robot switches to tool use: it grasps the spatula and performs a controlled push on the pot to translate it toward the table’s front. The plan emphasizes reliable perception, stable grasps, and short, safe motions with binned parameters.",
