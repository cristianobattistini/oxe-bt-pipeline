  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The scene shows a tabletop with a small pot and lid, a plate (shallow dish), and a flat spatula-like tool. A robot arm must first expose the pot by removing/opening it, then grasp and relocate the pot to the plate. After placement, the robot employs the nearby spatula as a pushing tool to slide the pot toward the tableâ€™s front edge, aligning it with the operator. The sequence prioritizes reliable perception, gentle contact, and short, controlled motions within the tabletop workspace.",
    "preconditions": ["Pot, lid, plate, and spatula present and reachable", "Table surface is clear enough for motion", "Robot is homed with an empty gripper", "Sensing available to detect pot and lid"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect pot and lid", "Open container by removing the lid", "Prepare gripper and compute a top grasp for the pot", "Grasp the pot securely", "Place the pot at the designated pose on the plate", "Use the spatula to push the pot toward the table front", "Retreat to a safe height"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid no longer covering the pot", "Pot rests on the plate stably", "Pot translated toward the front edge as intended", "Robot ends in a safe, non-contact state"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, re-run detection", "If grasp fails, recompute grasp and retry", "If push stalls due to friction, shorten distance and reattempt", "If placement is misaligned, re-place with adjusted yaw"],
    "termination": "Terminate once the pot is on the plate and pushed forward, and the arm has retreated to a safe pose."
