  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene shows a small pot with a lid on the right workstation, a flat plate on the black mat, and a spatula tool nearby. The robot must first remove the pot’s lid, then grasp and relocate the pot onto the plate. Finally, it should pick the spatula and push the pot toward the front side of the table, achieving a clear final placement near the table’s front edge while maintaining stability.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear of obstacles along the approach path.", "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are visible.", "Gripper calibrated and able to grasp pot sidewall and tool handle."],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect pot and verify visibility.", "Approach above pot and open it (remove lid).", "Compute and execute a side grasp on the pot.", "Lift and place the pot on the plate.", "Detect and grasp the spatula.", "Push the pot toward the table front while on the plate.", "Release tool and retreat."],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid is off the pot.", "Pot is stably resting on the plate.", "Pot has been pushed toward the front edge by the commanded distance.", "Robot ends safely clear of objects."],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, re-detect from a slightly higher view.", "If grasp slips, reopen gripper, recompute grasp, and retry.", "If push direction is off, re-approach and repeat a shorter push."],
    "termination": "Terminate once the pot is on the plate near the table front and the robot has released the tool and retreated."
