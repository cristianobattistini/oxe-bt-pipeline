    "overview": "A table-top robot interacts with a small cooking scene. Objects include a pot with a lid, a plate, a spatula-like tool, and a counter board. The goal is to remove the lid from the pot, relocate the pot so it sits on the plate, and finally use the spatula to push the pot toward the front of the table. The behavior tree sequences perception, opening, grasping, placement, tool pickup, pushing, and a final retreat. Timeouts, discrete forces, and directions are snapped to the allowed bins.",
