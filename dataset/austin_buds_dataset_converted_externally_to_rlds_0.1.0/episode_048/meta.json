  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene with a robot arm, a pot initially with its lid on a stovetop panel, a plate on the left workspace, and a spatula tool nearby. The robot must first open the pot by removing its lid, then grasp and relocate the pot onto the plate. Finally, the robot uses the spatula as a tool to push the pot forward (toward the table’s front/operator side), achieving a final pose closer to the edge. Actions must be deliberate and respect gentle contact when placing.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are within reachable workspace",
      "Perception can detect pot and spatula",

      "Use the spatula to push the pot toward the front edge.",
      "Set the spatula down and release."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is no longer on the pot",
      "Pot rests stably on the plate",
      "Pot is pushed forward compared to its initial plate pose",

      "If perception fails, retry detection or adjust viewpoint",
      "If grasp slips, re-compute grasp and try again",
      "If push direction is off, reattempt push with corrected alignment",
      "If placement misses plate, re-grasp and re-place"
