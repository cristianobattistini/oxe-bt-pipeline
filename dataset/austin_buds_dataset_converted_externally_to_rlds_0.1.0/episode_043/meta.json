  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation episode with a 6-DoF arm interacts with a lidded pot, a small plate, and a flat spatula-like tool arranged on a mat near a mock stovetop. The sequence requires first uncovering the pot by removing its lid, then grasping and relocating the pot so it rests on the plate. After placement, the robot must pick the tool and execute a controlled push that moves the pot toward the table’s front edge while maintaining contact and stability. The setting contains nearby bowls and burners that create clutter and potential occlusions. Accurate perception and gentle, well-aligned motion are needed to avoid collisions and spills.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot reachable workspace includes pot, lid, plate, and tool", "Perception detects pot and plate poses with reasonable confidence", "Gripper free at start to manipulate lid and pot", "Tool is accessible on the table without being occluded"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Open gripper and perceive the pot and lid", "Approach the pot and open its lid using lid-removal primitive", "Compute a side grasp for the pot and grasp securely", "Lift and place the pot onto the plate", "Perceive and grasp the spatula tool", "Align to the pot and push it toward the table front", "Pause to settle, then retreat and release the tool"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid removed and not covering the pot", "Pot rests stably centered on the plate", "Pot translated toward the table’s front by the commanded push distance", "No collisions with burners, bowls, or table edges"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception failure: re-detect targets or slightly re-approach to reduce occlusion", "Unstable grasp: reopen gripper, recompute grasp, and retry", "Misaligned push: re-align to pot and repeat push with shorter distance", "Placement drift: regrasp and re-place before pushing"],
    "termination": "Terminate when pot is on the plate, the push is executed, and the arm retreats with gripper open."
