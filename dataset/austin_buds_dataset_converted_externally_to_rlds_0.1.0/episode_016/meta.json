  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene features a small pot with a lid on a cooktop board, a beige plate to the left, and a spatula tool nearby. The robot first reveals the potâ€™s contents by opening the lid, then grasps the pot and relocates it onto the plate. After placing the pot, the robot picks the spatula and performs a guided push to slide the pot toward the front of the table without tipping or spilling. Movements should be deliberate and collision-free.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are on the table within reachable workspace",
      "Camera view provides visibility for detection",

      "Pot sticks while pushing: increase push distance in small increments"
