  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene features a small pot with a lid, a flat plate to the left, a spatula-like tool, and a larger bowl on the right. The robot must first open the pot by removing its lid, then grasp and relocate the pot onto the plate. Finally, it should pick the spatula and push the pot toward the front of the table, which corresponds to motion toward the image bottom. Actions are sequenced with simple perception, grasp, place, and push primitives.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are within reachable workspace",

      "Perceive and grasp the spatula tool.",
      "Push the pot toward the front edge of the table.",
      "Retreat to clear the workspace."

      "Plate pose unavailable: re-detect or fall back to approximate placement on plate area",
