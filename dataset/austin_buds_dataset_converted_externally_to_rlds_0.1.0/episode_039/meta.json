  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene with a robot arm, a pot with a removable lid, a round plate, and a spatula-like tool. The robot first uncovers the pot by taking off the lid and setting it aside. Next, it grasps the pot and positions it on the plate. Finally, it grasps the spatula and uses it to push the pot toward the front edge of the table. Movements should be deliberate, with short timeouts and light forces to avoid disturbing nearby items.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are on the table and reachable",

      "Gripper functioning and calibrated",

      "Detect and grasp the pot lid using a top grasp; lift and place it on the table.",
      "Detect the pot; compute a side grasp; lift and place it onto the plate.",
      "Detect and grasp the spatula; align to the pot; push the pot toward the table front; place the tool back and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid removed and resting on the table",
      "Pot placed centered or reasonably stable on the plate",
      "Pot displaced toward the front by the push, with no spillage or toppling"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If grasp fails, re-detect and recompute the grasp pose, then retry with a different strategy (top vs side).",
      "If placement on the plate is misaligned, re-grasp and re-place using PlaceOnSurface again.",
      "If push does not move the pot sufficiently, re-align and perform a second push."
    ],
    "termination": "End when the pot is on the plate and visibly closer to the front edge; tool returned to table and arm retreated."
