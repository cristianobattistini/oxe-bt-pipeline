  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene with a small pot with lid, a round plate, a large bowl, and a spatula tool. The arm must first open the pot by removing its lid. Next, it should grasp the pot and place it neatly on the plate. Finally, the robot switches to the tool: it grasps the spatula and uses it to push the pot toward the front edge of the table, aligning the motion along the table plane while keeping contact stable and avoiding collisions.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot, lid, plate, and spatula are within reachable workspace",

      "Align the tool to the pot and push it toward the front",

    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is off the pot",

      "If detection fails, re-run detection",
      "If grasp fails, recompute grasp and retry",

    ],
    "termination": "Task ends after the push completes and the arm retreats with gripper released."
