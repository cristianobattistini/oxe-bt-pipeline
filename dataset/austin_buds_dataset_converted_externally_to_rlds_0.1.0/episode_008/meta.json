  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A single-arm tabletop robot operates on a setup with a small pot (with a removable lid), a plate, and a spatula-like tool. The robot must first open the pot by removing its lid, then grasp the pot and place it on the nearby plate. After placing, the robot grasps the spatula tool and, while aligning to the pot, pushes the pot toward the front edge of the table to complete the task. Motions should be deliberate with short per-step timeouts and gentle placement on the plate.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Pot with lid, plate, and spatula are visible on the workspace",

      "Align to pot and push it toward the front of the table.",

      "If lid sticks: re-detect and retry open with a second attempt (not encoded here).",
      "If grasp fails: recompute grasp and retry.",
      "If push deviates: re-align to pot and repeat push."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate when pot is on plate and has been pushed toward the front; robot has executed final retreat."
