  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a robot arm, a small pot with a removable lid, a round plate, a spatula-like tool, and a countertop with burner markings. The robot must first take the lid off the pot and set it aside safely. Next, it should pick up the pot and place it accurately on the plate. Finally, using the spatula as a tool, the robot pushes the pot forward toward the tableâ€™s front edge, ensuring stable contact and avoiding collisions with nearby items.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace clear around pot, plate, and tool", "Gripper functioning and empty at start", "Spatula tool reachable on the table", "Plate provides a stable placement area"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect pot, lid, plate, and tool", "Grasp and lift off the lid; place it on the table", "Grasp the pot and place it onto the plate", "Use spatula to push the pot toward the front edge", "Retreat to a safe pose"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid removed from pot", "Pot centered on plate within small pose error", "Pot pushed toward front edge by the commanded distance", "End in safe, collision-free configuration"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, rescan or adjust view", "If grasp slips, reopen gripper and recompute grasp", "If placement unstable, regrasp and reseat pot", "If tool push stalls, re-approach and push again with smaller distance"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the pot is on the plate and has been pushed forward, with the arm safely retreated."
