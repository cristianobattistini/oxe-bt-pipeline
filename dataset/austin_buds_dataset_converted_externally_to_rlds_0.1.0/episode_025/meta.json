  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene with a small pot initially covered by a lid on a board near a larger pan. A plate/trivet sits nearby and a spatula tool is on the black mat. The robot must first remove and stow the pot’s lid on the board, then grasp and place the pot onto the plate. Finally, the robot must pick the spatula and push the pot forward toward the table’s front edge. Movements should be stable with moderate grasp force and surface contact.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear around pot, lid, plate, and spatula.", "Camera view provides visibility of targets.", "Gripper calibrated and tool usable for pushing."],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect and grasp the pot lid from above.", "Lift lid and place it on the board.", "Detect and grasp the pot; place it centered on the plate.", "Detect and grasp the spatula tool.", "Use the spatula to push the pot toward the front edge.", "Retreat to a safe pose."],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid is removed from pot and left on the board.", "Pot is placed on the plate with stable support.", "Pot is pushed toward the table front by the tool by the commanded distance.", "Robot ends in a safe, non-contact pose."],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, re-run detection and alignment.", "If grasp is unstable, reopen, recompute grasp, and retry.", "If pushing slips, re-approach and re-push in smaller increments.", "If placement misaligned, regrasp pot and re-place on plate."],
    "termination": "Terminate after the final retreat following a successful push with the pot near the front edge."
