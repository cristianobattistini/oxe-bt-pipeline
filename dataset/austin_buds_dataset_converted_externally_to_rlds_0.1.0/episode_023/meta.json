  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene with a robot arm, a lidded pot, a plate positioned nearby, and a spatula tool. The robot must first remove the pot’s lid, then grasp the pot and place it on the plate. After placing, the robot picks the spatula and uses it to push the pot toward the front edge of the table, as seen in later frames. The sequence requires reliable perception, stable grasps, gentle placement on the plate, tool pickup, alignment to the pot, and a straight push motion toward the operator-facing table edge.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace clear with pot, plate, and spatula visible on the table",

      "If grasp unstable: reopen gripper, recompute grasp, and retry",
      "If push slips: re-align to pot and repeat push",

      "If placement contact detected early: lower slowly and re-place"
    ],
    "termination": "Task terminates after the pot is on the plate and has been pushed toward the table front, with the tool safely released and arm retreated."
