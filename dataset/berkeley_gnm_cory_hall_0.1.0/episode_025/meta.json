    "overview": "A mobile robot navigates an indoor hallway toward a distant, bright rectangular goal area visible at the end of the corridor. The camera shows progressively closer views of the same end-wall target, suggesting straightforward, straight-line navigation with minor alignment near arrival. The behavior emphasizes checking whether the robot is already at the goal, attempting navigation with bounded time and retries, then performing a short alignment to settle precisely at the destination. No manipulation is required; perception is implicit in goal checks and alignment tolerance.",
