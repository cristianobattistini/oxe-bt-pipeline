  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The scene shows a forward-facing camera moving through a narrow hallway with white walls, dark floor trim, and ceiling lights, converging toward a brighter doorway at the far end. The task is pure navigation: reach the designated goal at the corridor’s end while keeping a stable heading. The behavior tree first checks whether the robot is already at the goal; if not, it commands a named-location navigation with a bounded attempt time and limited retries to handle transient issues like brief blockage or local planner hiccups.",

      "Robot is localized in the hallway map.",
