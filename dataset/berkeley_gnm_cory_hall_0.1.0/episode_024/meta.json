  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile robot navigates a corridor in Cory Hall toward a designated goal location, likely indicated by signage or a visual marker near a doorway and a QR-style poster visible in later frames. The behavior uses a brief perception step to detect a goal marker, then drives toward a named goal while retrying if motion fails. The corridor appears open with door alcoves and wall fixtures along the path, so alignment and straight-line progress are prioritized. Success is verified by reaching the goal location after approach.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is localized and map includes a named location 'goal'.",
