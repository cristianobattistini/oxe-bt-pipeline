  "task_summary": "PR2 detects the fridge handle, approaches and aligns, grasps the handle, opens the hinged fridge door, verifies it is open, releases, and retreats.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 robot opens a household fridge. The scene shows a white hinged refrigerator near drawers. The robot must perceive the handle, approach with correct yaw, and take a stable grasp. It then executes a door-opening motion suitable for a hinged door, checks that the door is open, releases the handle, and backs away to a safe pose. The plan emphasizes reliable perception, precise alignment, and a controlled pull to swing the door open without collision.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Fridge is reachable and unlatched",
      "Handle is visible or can be found by scanning",
      "Manipulator and gripper are operational",
      "Workspace is free of blocking obstacles"
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "If the handle is not visible, scan to find it and confirm detection.",
      "Move to a pre-grasp in front of the fridge and set end-effector yaw.",
      "Open gripper, compute grasp for a pulling strategy, and align to the handle.",
      "Close gripper to acquire the handle.",
      "Execute a door-opening action for a hinged fridge door.",
      "Verify the container is open, release the handle, and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Door angle increases to a clearly open state",
      "Robot maintains stable grasp during pulling",
      "No collisions with fridge or surroundings",
      "Robot ends at a safe retreat pose"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Handle not detected: perform scanning routine and retry detection",
      "Misalignment or slip: re-open gripper, realign, and re-grasp",
      "Door resists motion: attempt a second opening with increased dwell time",
      "Perception noise: re-detect handle before continuing"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate once the fridge is confirmed open, the handle is released, and the robot has retreated to a safe distance."
