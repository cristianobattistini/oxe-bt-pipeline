  "task_summary": "Detect the fridge and its handle, approach and grasp the handle, pull to open the hinged fridge door, verify it is open, and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 robot operates in a cluttered kitchenette. The goal is to open a standard hinged fridge door. The robot must perceive the fridge and handle, align precisely, grasp with appropriate force, and perform an opening motion using a container-level primitive. After actuation, it verifies the door state and retreats to a safe distance, leaving the opening unobstructed. Timing is moderate; accuracy in alignment and stable grasp on the handle are crucial to avoid slipping or scraping nearby drawers.",
    "preconditions": ["Fridge and handle are within the workspace.", "No blocking obstacles preventing door swing.", "Robot has free end-effector and sufficient reach."],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect fridge and handle.", "Verify handle visibility.", "Approach and align to the handle at tight tolerance.", "Open gripper and establish grasp.", "Execute door opening primitive for a hinged door.", "Confirm door is open.", "Retreat from the opened doorway."],
    "success_criteria": ["Fridge door visibly open beyond initial closed pose.", "Handle grasp is stable during motion.", "Robot ends in a safe, retracted pose."],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception miss → re-detect handle.", "Misalignment → re-approach with tighter tolerance.", "Grasp slip → reopen gripper and retry grasp.", "Door stuck → slightly re-approach and re-open with longer timeout."],
    "termination": "Terminate when the door-open condition is satisfied and the robot has retreated to a safe distance."
