  "task_summary": "PR2 opens a hinged fridge door by locating the handle, aligning and grasping it, pulling the door open, verifying it is open, then retreating and releasing.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The scene shows a PR2 robot in front of a white fridge. The robot must open the fridge by first perceiving the handle, approaching and aligning its end-effector, setting an appropriate yaw to match the bar, grasping with moderate force, and actuating the door open along the hinge. Once the door swings to a clearly open angle, the robot confirms success, retreats to clear the swing path, and releases the handle. Timing is modest, with accurate alignment needed to avoid slipping.",
    "preconditions": ["Fridge is reachable from robot base", "Door is closed at start", "Handle is unobstructed", "Workspace is collision-free on the door swing side"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Open gripper", "Perceive/scan for fridge handle", "Approach and align to handle with tight tolerance", "Rotate wrist to ~90° for bar handle", "Close gripper to secure grasp", "Execute door opening motion (open container)", "Verify fridge door is open", "Retreat to clear door", "Release handle"],
    "success_criteria": ["Door angle visibly open", "ContainerOpen(fridge_door) condition satisfied", "Robot not in contact with door after retreat", "Handle released at end"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception fails -> rescan with retries", "Misalignment -> re-approach and realign", "Grip slip -> reopen and regrasp", "Door jam/collision -> stop, retreat slightly, retry open"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the fridge door is confirmed open and the robot has retreated and released the handle."
