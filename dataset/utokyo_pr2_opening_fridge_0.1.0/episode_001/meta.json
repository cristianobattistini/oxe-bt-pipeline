  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 manipulator opens a small white refrigerator with a hinged door. The scene includes a fridge next to drawers and the robotâ€™s gripper approaching the handle. The behavior first ensures the handle is perceived, then aligns the end-effector, prepares a grasp pose, grasps the handle, and executes an opening motion via a high-level container action. The door state is verified after pulling, and the arm retreats to a safe distance. Timing bins and tolerances are conservative to reduce collisions in the tight office-like setting.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is powered and within reach of the fridge",
      "No obstacles block the handle trajectory",
      "Gripper is functional and can close on the handle"

      "Perceive or scan to localize the fridge handle",
      "Approach and align to the handle with tight tolerance",

      "Pick the handle using the computed grasp",
      "Open the fridge door (hinged) using a pull",
      "Verify the door is open and retreat"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Fridge door angle visibly increases and remains open",
      "Container open condition satisfied",
      "Arm retreats to a safe standoff without collisions"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If handle not visible, raster scan and re-detect",
      "If grasp fails, recompute grasp and retry pick",
      "If door resists, re-align and repeat opening motion"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate once the door is reported open and the robot has retreated to a safe position."
