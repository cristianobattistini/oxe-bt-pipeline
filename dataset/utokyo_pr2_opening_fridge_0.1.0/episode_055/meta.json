  "task_summary": "Grasp the fridge handle and open the hinged door, then retreat to a safe distance.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 robot approaches a closed fridge, locates the handle, aligns its gripper, grasps using a pulling strategy, and opens the hinged door before retreating. The scene shows a domestic-style fridge beside drawers, with the robotâ€™s arm operating from the right side. The plan prioritizes reliable detection, stable grasping, and a single decisive door-opening action using an abstract OpenContainer node. Safety includes verifying grasp stability and a short retreat after the door swings open.",
    "preconditions": ["Fridge is reachable by the manipulator", "Hinged door operates freely without obstructions", "Fridge handle is visible or discoverable via scanning", "Robot has control authority over gripper and arm"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Navigate/position near the fridge", "Scan and detect the fridge handle", "Pre-open gripper and compute a pull grasp", "Align to the handle and set gripper yaw", "Close gripper and verify grasp stability", "If not already open, execute door opening for a hinged door", "Retreat slightly and pause"],
    "success_criteria": ["Door is detected to be open", "Robot maintains stability without collisions", "End effector retreats to a safe offset"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Handle not detected: re-scan or adjust viewpoint", "Grasp slip: reopen, realign, and regrasp", "Door jammed: apply a second open attempt after re-aligning", "Unexpected collision: stop, retreat, and replan"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the fridge reports open and the robot has retreated to a safe distance."
