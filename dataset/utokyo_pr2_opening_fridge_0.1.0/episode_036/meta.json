  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 robot opens a household fridge. The scene shows a white hinged-door fridge beside a drawer unit. The robot must find the handle, align its gripper, grasp with low force, pull to swing the door, and then back away. The plan uses perception-first with a fallback scan, precise alignment before grasping, and an explicit container-opening action suitable for a hinged door. Verification of the door state and a retreat finalize the task.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot arm and gripper operational", "Fridge is closed and reachable", "Workspace free of blocking obstacles", "Perception available to localize handle"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Perceive/scan for the fridge handle", "Detect fridge door pose", "Pre-open gripper", "Move to pre-grasp near handle", "Compute grasp pose and confirm availability", "Approach and align precisely", "Close gripper on handle", "Execute door opening for hinged door", "Verify door is open", "Retreat and settle"],
    "success_criteria": ["Hinged fridge door is visibly open", "Robot releases and is clear of the door sweep", "No collisions or dropped items"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Handle not visible → scan fallback", "Misalignment → re-run approach/alignment", "Grip slip → reopen and realign then re-grasp", "Door resistance → increase approach precision or retry open"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the door is confirmed open and the robot has retreated to a safe distance."
