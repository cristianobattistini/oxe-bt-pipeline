  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The scene shows a PR2 robot interacting with a small hinged-door refrigerator among office furniture. The objective is to open the fridge door. The robot must first perceive the fridge and its handle, move to a pregrasp pose, align the tool, rotate the wrist to 90°, and grasp. It then pulls to open the hinged door, checks that the container is open, releases the handle, and retreats slightly to clear the workspace. No objects are removed; only the container is actuated.",
    "preconditions": ["Fridge is reachable by the PR2 arm", "Handle is visible from the camera view", "No obstacles block the pulling path", "Gripper operational and empty"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect fridge and handle", "Move in front of the fridge", "Approach and align to the handle with tight tolerance", "Open gripper and set yaw 90°", "Close gripper to grasp handle", "Open the container (hinged door) by pulling", "Verify the fridge is open", "Release handle", "Retreat and wait briefly"],
    "success_criteria": ["Fridge door angle increased from closed state", "ContainerOpen(fridge) condition returns true", "Robot ends with opened door and gripper released", "No collisions with the environment"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception fails: re-detect handle or slightly reposition", "Grasp slips: reopen gripper, re-align, re-grasp", "Door stuck: increase pull duration within safety bounds", "Collision risk: abort opening and retreat"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the fridge is reported open, handle is released, and the robot has retreated to a safe distance."
