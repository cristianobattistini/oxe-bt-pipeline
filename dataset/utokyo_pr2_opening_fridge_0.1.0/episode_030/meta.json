  "task_summary": "PR2 detects the fridge door, approaches and grasps the handle, pulls to open the hinged door, verifies it is open, and retreats.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 robot operates in a cluttered office/kitchen area to open a small refrigerator. The robot must visually locate the fridge door and handle, approach while keeping clearance from nearby drawers and obstacles, orient its wrist for a pulling motion, grasp the handle, and pull the hinged door open. Once the door swings wide and the interior is visible, the robot verifies the door state and retreats to a safe viewing pose. Timing and forces are moderate; precision alignment around the handle is important to avoid slipping or scraping.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Fridge is reachable by the PR2 arm",
      "Handle is unobstructed",
      "Door is unlocked and free to swing",

      "Confirm door is open",
      "Retreat to a safe distance"

    "success_criteria": [
      "ContainerOpen(fridge_door) evaluates true",

      "If detection fails: re-detect and slightly adjust viewpoint",
      "If alignment/grasp slips: reopen gripper, re-approach, and re-grasp",
      "If door sticks: retry opening after adjusting yaw and approach"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after ContainerOpen is true and a retreat to the nominal viewing pose is completed."
