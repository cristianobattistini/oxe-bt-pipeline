  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 manipulator opens a compact refrigerator in a cluttered lab corner. The arm must find the handle, align precisely, grasp, and pull the hinged door to swing it open. The contact sheet shows progression from approach to a fully opened door and postâ€‘action retreat. Constraints include limited space beside drawers and the fridge, accurate handle localization, secure grasp stability, and collision avoidance during the door swing arc.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot base is positioned within reach of the fridge", "Fridge is closed at start", "No human in arm workspace", "Gripper operational and free of objects"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Navigate arm near fridge front", "Perceive and localize the fridge handle", "Compute a pulling grasp", "Open gripper and align to handle", "Execute grasp using planned pose", "Pull via door opening action", "Verify door is open and clear", "Retreat from the door swing path"],
    "success_criteria": ["Door angle visibly increases from closed to open state", "Grasp remains stable during pull", "No collisions with drawers or surroundings", "Arm retreats clear of the open door"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Handle not detected: rescan with raster pattern and adjust approach", "Grasp slip: re-open gripper, recompute grasp, and retry", "Door jam or obstruction: stop, verify contact forces, and try smaller pulls", "Perception noise: revalidate visibility before grasp"],
    "termination": "Terminate when ContainerOpen confirms the fridge door is open and the arm has retreated the specified distance."
