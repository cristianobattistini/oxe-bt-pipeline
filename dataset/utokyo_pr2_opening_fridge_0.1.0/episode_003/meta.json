  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator (PR2) is positioned in front of a small refrigerator. The goal is to open the fridge door. The robot must perceive the door/handle region, align its end-effector with suitable yaw, establish a secure grasp, and pull to swing the hinged door open. Visual confirmation of the opening and a safe retreat complete the task. The workspace is tight near a drawer unit; careful alignment and moderate pulling force are required.",

      "Fridge door initially closed",
