  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In a cluttered kitchen-lab scene, a PR2 opens a small refrigerator. The robot must perceive the fridge, approach the door handle, align its end-effector, grasp, and pull to swing the hinged door open. The door opens toward the robot, so wrist yaw alignment helps achieve a straight pull. After opening, the robot verifies the door state and retreats to a safe distance before releasing. Timing is moderate and accuracy during approach is important to avoid collisions with nearby drawers and the fridge frame.",
    "preconditions": ["Fridge present and reachable", "Handle accessible on the right-side door", "No obstacles blocking swing path", "Robot base roughly positioned near the fridge"],

    "success_criteria": ["ContainerOpen condition for the fridge door succeeds", "Door visually open by a clear margin", "Robot ends at a safe standoff with gripper released"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception miss: retry DetectObject up to 3 times", "Misalignment: re-run ApproachAndAlign", "Slip during pull: re-close gripper and reattempt OpenContainer", "Collision risk: retreat briefly and re-approach"],
    "termination": "Tree terminates after successful door open verification, retreat, and release."
