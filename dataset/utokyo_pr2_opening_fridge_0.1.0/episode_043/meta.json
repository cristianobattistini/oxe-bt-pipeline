  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 robot opens a standard hinged refrigerator door. The robot first perceives the fridge door panel and handle region, then moves to a pre-grasp pose and aligns the end-effector. After preparing the gripper, it grasps the handle, rotates its wrist to a pulling-friendly yaw, and executes the door-opening action. Once the door swings open, the robot retreats slightly to avoid collision with the opening door and pauses briefly. The scene shows a white fridge beside drawers; interior shelves become visible as the door opens.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Fridge door initially closed and reachable",
      "Path to handle is free of obstacles",

      "Rotate wrist to 90Â° yaw and open the hinged door.",
      "Retreat a short distance and wait to stabilize."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Fridge interior becomes visible (door clearly open).",
      "No collision with door or surroundings.",
      "Robot safely retracted from the open door area."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Detection fails: rescan and adjust viewpoint.",
      "Misalignment: reopen gripper, realign, and retry grasp.",
      "Handle slip: increase grip force within safe bounds and retry.",
      "Door stuck: repeat opening with adjusted approach or wrist yaw."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate once the door is open and the robot has retreated and stabilized."
