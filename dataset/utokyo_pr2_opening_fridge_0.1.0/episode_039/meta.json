  "task_summary": "Detect the fridge handle, approach and align, prepare and grasp with the gripper, open the hinged fridge door, confirm it is open, then retreat to a safe pose.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 manipulator opens a household refrigerator door. The scene shows a closed fridge next to drawers. The robot must visually localize the handle, approach with precise alignment, set end-effector yaw for a lateral pull, prepare the gripper, secure a grasp, and actuate the door. The door is a hinged container that swings outward. Movements should be deliberate and collision-free. After opening, the robot verifies the door state and retreats to clear the door swing.",
    "preconditions": ["Fridge is reachable and unobstructed", "Door initially closed", "Handle graspable by parallel gripper", "Robot base stable and arm workspace clear"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect handle location", "Approach and align to handle", "Open gripper and set yaw to 90°", "Refine alignment for tight grasp", "Close gripper to secure handle", "Open the hinged door", "Verify door open state", "Retreat from the doorway"],
    "success_criteria": ["Door visibly open with interior exposed", "ContainerOpen condition true for fridge_door", "No collisions with drawers or door", "Robot ends in a safe, cleared pose"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Detection fails: re-detect or adjust viewpoint", "Misalignment: repeat approach with tighter tolerance", "Slip: reopen and regrasp", "Door jam/collision: stop, retreat, and reattempt with corrected yaw"],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful ContainerOpen check followed by retreat, or upon unrecoverable failure."
