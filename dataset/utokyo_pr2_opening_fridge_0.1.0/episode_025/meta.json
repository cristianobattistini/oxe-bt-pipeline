  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "In an office kitchen-like scene, a PR2 robot must open a small refrigerator. The sequence begins with perception to detect the fridge and its handle, followed by navigation/arm approach and fine alignment. The gripper opens and a grasp pose is computed for a pulling strategy. After a stable grasp, the robot executes an abstract open action for a hinged door, retreats to avoid collision with the swinging door, and performs a final check that the door is open. Timing is moderate and tolerances are tight to avoid scraping the cabinet.",
