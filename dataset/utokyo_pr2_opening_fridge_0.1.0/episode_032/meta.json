  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 mobile manipulator is tasked with opening a right-hinged refrigerator door. The scene shows a closed fridge near a drawer cabinet. The robot must first perceive the handle area, approach and align its end-effector, establish a secure grasp, then execute a pulling motion to swing the door open. After opening, it verifies the container state and backs away to a safe pose. Timing is moderate, precision alignment is required near the handle, and collision with surrounding furniture should be avoided.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot base is positioned within reachable workspace of the fridge handle",
      "End-effector free and gripper operational",
      "Fridge door is closed and unlatched",

      "Verify the door is open and retreat to a safe distance."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Door angle increases and interior is visible",
      "No collisions with cabinet or door",
