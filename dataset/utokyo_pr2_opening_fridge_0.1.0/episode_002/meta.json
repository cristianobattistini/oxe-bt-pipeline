  "task_summary": "PR2 localizes the fridge handle, approaches, grasps, pulls to open the hinged door, verifies it is open, retreats, and releases.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The scene shows a PR2 robot opening a small white fridge next to a drawer cabinet. The contact sheet depicts perception of the closed door, approach to the handle, alignment, grasp, and a pull that swings the hinged door open, revealing the interior shelves. The behavior prioritizes reliable perception, gentle but firm grasping, and a smooth pull while keeping the base and arm clear of the door swing. After confirming the door is open, the robot retreats to a safe distance and releases the handle.",

      "Fridge is reachable by the PR2 arm",
