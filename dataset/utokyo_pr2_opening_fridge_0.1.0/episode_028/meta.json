  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 robot interacts with a standard household fridge. The sequence begins with visual detection of the handle on a hinged door. The robot moves to a pregrasp pose, refines alignment, and orients its tool frame for a pulling motion. After forming a stable grasp on the handle, it executes the door-opening motion and confirms the container is open. The final step is to retreat to a safe distance, revealing the fridge interior. Constraints include tight alignment near furniture and limited workspace.",
