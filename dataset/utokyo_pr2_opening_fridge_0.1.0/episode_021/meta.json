  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 robot operates in a cluttered lab kitchen corner to open a small refrigerator. The sequence begins with perception of the fridge and a short approach to the door region. The end-effector yaw is set to align with the vertical door edge/handle. The robot refines alignment, actuates an open on the hinged door, confirms the door is open, and finally backs away to a safe standoff. The environment includes drawers and nearby obstacles, so motions should be deliberate with modest timeouts.",

      "Fridge is closed and reachable",
