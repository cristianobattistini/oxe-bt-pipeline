  "task_summary": "Detect the fridge door, approach and grasp the handle/edge, pull to open the hinged door, then retreat and release.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 robot opens a small refrigerator. The camera shows the fridge frontally with a bar-like edge/handle on the right side. The robot first perceives the door, approaches the handle region, aligns the end-effector, grasps, and pulls to swing the hinged door open. Once open, the interior shelves become visible. The sequence emphasizes reliable perception, stable grasp, and a smooth pulling motion followed by a short retreat and release to avoid recontact. Timeouts are moderate to account for manipulation and door inertia.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot base is positioned within reach of the fridge door", "Manipulator is free and gripper operational", "Fridge door is initially closed or ajar", "Scene lighting sufficient for visual detection"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Perceive the fridge door target", "Open gripper and move to a pregrasp near the handle/edge", "Align precisely to the handle region", "Close gripper to secure the edge/handle", "Optionally yaw wrist to a pulling orientation", "Open the container (hinged door) by pulling", "Retreat slightly, release, and pause"],
    "success_criteria": ["Door angle increases so interior shelves are visible", "Condition ContainerOpen(fridge_door) holds true", "Robot ends clear of the swinging door with no collisions"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, retry perception", "If alignment fails, re-approach with precise tolerance", "If grasp is unstable, reopen gripper and repeat approach", "If door resists, extend open duration then retreat and retry"],
    "termination": "Terminate after the door is confirmed open and the robot has retreated and released."
