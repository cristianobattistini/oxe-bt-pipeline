  "task_summary": "The robot detects the fridge handle, approaches and aligns, grasps the handle, pulls to open the hinged fridge door, verifies it is open, then retreats.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 robot operates in a kitchen-like scene with a compact fridge next to a drawer unit. The goal is to open the fridge door. The robot first ensures the handle is visible (with a retrying scan if needed), drives to the frontal pose, aligns its end-effector, and sets wrist yaw for a lateral pull on a bar handle. It opens the gripper, computes a grasp on the handle, executes the grasp, and pulls via a high-level door-opening action for a hinged door. Success is verified visually, and the robot retreats to clear the workspace.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Fridge present with a hinged door and accessible handle",
      "No obstacles blocking approach path",

      "Open gripper, compute grasp pose for pulling, and pick the handle.",
      "Execute door opening for a hinged door.",
      "Verify the fridge is open and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Handle grasp is stable",
