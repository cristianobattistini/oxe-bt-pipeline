  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 arm interacts with a pink cloth on a wooden tabletop. The robot first ensures the cloth is visible, then approaches above it with an open gripper. It aligns to the surface, lowers until contact is detected, and performs a lateral push to fold the cloth onto itself. The sequence favors gentle contact and controlled motion. No grasping is required; the fold is induced by surface contact and pushing. After the fold motion, the arm retreats and pauses briefly to stabilize.",
