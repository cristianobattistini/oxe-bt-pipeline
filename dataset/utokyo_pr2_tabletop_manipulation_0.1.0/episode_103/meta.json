  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 gripper operates over a green mat with a white plate and a bread piece. The robot must perceive the bread, approach with a precise pre-grasp, and execute a gentle, stable pinch grasp. After securing the item, the gripper lifts, navigates to a pose above the plate, and places the bread at the plate’s center before releasing and retreating. The sequence emphasizes reliable perception, alignment, contact-aware descent, and safe placement consistent with the frames showing pick and place.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot and cameras calibrated; workspace clear",
