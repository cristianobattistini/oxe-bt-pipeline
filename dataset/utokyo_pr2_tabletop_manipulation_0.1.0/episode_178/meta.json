  "task_summary": "Fold the pink cloth on the tabletop via push-and-press using a single PR2 arm, then retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 arm interacts with a pink cloth on a wooden tabletop to execute a single-fold using a push-based strategy visible across nine frames. The robot first perceives and approaches the cloth, aligns its end effector, gently makes contact, and pushes the cloth edge leftward to create a fold. After completing the push, it performs a brief press to set the crease and then retreats from the workspace. The sequence is consistent with the frames showing approach from the right, contact, progressive folding into a compact rectangle, and final withdrawal.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cloth lies flat and reachable on the table",
      "Robot workspace is clear of obstacles",
      "End effector suitable for pushing with open gripper",
      "Camera provides clear overhead view"
    ],

      "Detect and verify visibility of the cloth",
      "Move above and align yaw with fold direction",
      "Open gripper and lower until contact with the cloth edge",
      "Execute one long push and a short finishing push leftward",
      "Press lightly to set the crease",
      "Retreat and pause to stabilize"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Cloth appears folded into a smaller, thicker rectangle",
      "Folded state remains after tool retreat",
      "No object slip or unintended displacement off the table"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If perception fails, repeat detection and re-approach",
      "If contact is missed, lower again with small depth and retry push",
      "If fold is shallow, perform the short finishing push once more",
      "If cloth bunches, retreat, re-align, and re-contact before pushing"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after retreat and brief wait once a stable folded configuration is observed."
