  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2-style manipulator interacts with a tabletop scene containing a plate and a small grape cluster. The goal is to pick a single grape, using gentle, precise motions due to the small size and potential occlusion by the cluster. The behavior includes perception with fallback scanning, grasp planning for a pinch strategy, a careful top-down approach, execution of the grasp, stability checking, and a safe retreat. The contact sheet frames show approach over the plate, contact at the grape location, and withdrawal away from the plate.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot initialized and homed", "Gripper operational and empty", "Workspace free of obstacles aside from plate and grapes", "Camera calibrated and providing images"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Open the gripper", "Perceive grape; if not visible, scan and detect", "Compute pinch grasp pose for a single grape", "Move above target with small vertical offset", "Approach and align with tight tolerance", "Execute pick using computed grasp", "Check grasp stability", "Retreat to a safe height"],
    "success_criteria": ["A single grape is held securely in the gripper", "No collisions with plate or table", "Retreat completed to a safe pose"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Target not visible: trigger spiral scan and re-detect", "Grasp plan invalid: recompute grasp", "Pick fails or slip detected: re-open gripper and retry from perception", "Timeouts: abort current leaf and re-enter perception fallback"],
    "termination": "Terminate after a stable grasp is confirmed and a retreat is completed."
