  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2-style manipulator folds a small pink cloth on a wooden tabletop. The robot first perceives the cloth, approaches from above, aligns its gripper to the cloth’s edge, and plans a pinch grasp. After grasping, it lifts slightly, translates the grasped edge across the cloth to create a fold, lowers until contact to flatten the fold, releases the cloth, and retreats. Movements are short and careful to maintain cloth control and avoid sweeping other objects.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cloth is visible on the table within reachable workspace",
      "Gripper and wrist free of obstructions",
      "Perception pipeline can localize 'cloth' edge sufficiently"

      "Detect the cloth",
      "Open gripper and move above the cloth",

      "Compute a pinch grasp and pick the edge",
      "Lift slightly (z) and translate laterally (y) to fold",
      "Lower until contact to press the fold",
      "Open gripper to release and retreat"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Cloth remains on table",
      "A visible fold is created with overlapped layers",
      "Gripper is empty and robot safely retracted"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails: rescan the area and reattempt detection",
      "If grasp slips: reopen, realign, recompute grasp, and retry pick",
      "If contact not detected while lowering: increase depth slightly and retry"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after release and a short wait once the arm has retreated from the workspace."
