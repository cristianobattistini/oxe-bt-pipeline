  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 gripper must pick up a small bread roll from a tabletop covered by a green cloth. A white saucer sits nearby but the instruction focuses only on picking the bread. The robot first ensures the bread is visible, then opens the gripper, moves above the bread with a small vertical offset, computes a pinch grasp, aligns precisely, closes to pick, lifts slightly, and retreats to a safe distance. Timing is moderate; alignment requires tight tolerance to avoid pushing the bread away.",

    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception failure → scan using raster pattern", "Misalignment or slip → sequence fails; re-run tree", "Grasp failed → no ObjectInGripper; operator or higher-level retry can re-tick"],
