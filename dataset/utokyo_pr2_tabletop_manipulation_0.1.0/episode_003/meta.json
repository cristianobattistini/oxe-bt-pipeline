  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A single PR2-like arm manipulates a pink cloth on a wooden tabletop. The goal is to fold the cloth by grasping one edge, lifting slightly, and dragging/pushing it over itself to create a clear crease. The sequence emphasizes careful approach, gentle contact, and a short lift followed by an in-plane push to achieve the fold. After forming the fold near the cloth center, the gripper presses to set the crease, releases the cloth, and retreats to a safe height, leaving the folded cloth on the table.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cloth is visible on the table",
      "Workspace is free of obstacles around the cloth",
      "Gripper operational and empty",
      "Table surface provides sufficient friction for folding by push/drag"
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Perceive and localize the cloth and a foldable edge.",
      "Open the gripper and move above the target edge.",
      "Align, descend until contact, and close the gripper on the edge.",
      "Lift slightly and push/drag the edge across the cloth to fold.",
      "Press at the fold center to set the crease.",
      "Open gripper and retreat to a safe pose."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "A visible, stable fold is formed",
      "Cloth remains within workspace bounds",
      "No unintended object displacement",
      "Robot ends at a safe, non-contact pose"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Cloth not detected: re-perceive or adjust view",
      "Missed grasp: reopen, realign, and retry approach",
      "Slip during push: reduce speed or re-grasp closer to edge",
      "Insufficient fold: repeat push/press from corrected start"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate when fold is formed and the arm has released the cloth and retreated safely."
