    "overview": "A PR2 arm must pick a grape from the workspace. The scene shows a plate on a tabletop, with the robot approaching from the upper-right. The behavior first perceives the target, then positions above it with a small clearance. A pinch-style grasp is computed and verified, the end-effector descends slowly to contact, and a pick action secures the grape. Once the grasp is stable and the object is held, the arm retreats to clear the plate and table area.",
