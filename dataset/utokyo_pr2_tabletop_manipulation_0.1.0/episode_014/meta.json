  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A single PR2 arm operates on a tabletop with a pink cloth. The goal is to fold the cloth by pressing its surface and pushing along a direction to create a crease, rather than grasping. The sequence emphasizes perception, precise alignment, gentle contact, and a controlled push. The gripper stays open and oriented at 90° to present a flat surface for pressing. Timeouts and short distances reflect careful, precise motion appropriate for deformable manipulation.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear except for the cloth", "Camera view available for cloth detection", "Gripper functional and open", "Table surface provides sufficient friction"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect the cloth", "Move above the cloth and orient the tool to 90°", "Align to the cloth edge/crease line", "Lower until contact to pin the cloth", "Push left by 0.1 m to form a fold", "Retreat and hover"],
    "success_criteria": ["A visible crease or partial fold is produced", "Cloth remains on table without slipping away", "No collision with table edges or robot body", "Arm retreats to a safe hover"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, retry detection up to 3 times", "If contact not detected, lower again with limited depth", "If push slips, re-align and repeat push", "If timeouts occur, abort and retreat"],
    "termination": "Behavior ends after retreating and hovering above the cloth following the push."
