  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 end-effector operates over a green table mat with a small plate and a bread piece. The robot must pick the bread using a gentle pinch grasp, confirming a stable hold before transporting it. Visual search ensures the bread is localized even under partial occlusion. After grasping, the robot lifts, transits to a position above the plate, lowers until contact is detected, releases, and retreats. Timing and force values are conservative to avoid deforming the bread and to avoid impacting the plate.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is powered and homed; workspace clear",
      "Plate and bread are on the mat within reach",
      "Gripper is empty and can open to 0.09 m",

      "Verify grasp stability and lift/retreat.",
      "Move above the plate, lower until contact, open gripper to release.",
      "Retreat to a safe height and wait briefly."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Bread is released centered on the plate",
