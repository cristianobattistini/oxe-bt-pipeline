    "overview": "A PR2-like gripper must pick a grape cluster placed on a wooden tabletop near a white plate. The robot first ensures visual contact with the grapes, computes a pinch-style grasp, aligns carefully, and executes the grasp. After confirming a stable hold, it retreats slightly and moves to a safe hover pose above the plate, consistent with the final frames showing the gripper holding grapes over the dish. The process prioritizes precise alignment and gentle handling appropriate for a delicate object.",
