    "overview": "A PR2-style parallel gripper works on a tabletop with a green mat, a white plate on the left, and a small bread piece on the right. The robot must detect the bread, approach and align for a side pinch, grasp securely, lift, transit toward the plate, lower until contact is detected, release the bread onto the plate, and then retreat to a safe pose. Timing uses binned timeouts; approach precision uses tight tolerance. The plate acts as the placement goal visible in several frames.",
