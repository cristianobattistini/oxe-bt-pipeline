  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 end-effector performs a tabletop manipulation where a single bread roll lies on a mat beside a small plate. The robot must perceive the bread, approach from above, compute a pinch grasp, close the gripper to secure the item, lift it, move to the plate, gently lower until contact, release, and retreat. Visual evidence shows a full pick-and-place despite the brief instruction mentioning only picking. The tree emphasizes reliable perception with retries, precise alignment before grasping, gentle placement, and a short post-release retreat to clear the scene.",
