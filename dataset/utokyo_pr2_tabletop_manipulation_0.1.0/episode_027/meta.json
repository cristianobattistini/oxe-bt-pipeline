  "task_summary": "Detect the pink cloth, grasp one edge with a pinch, lift slightly, pull to fold, place it down, release, lightly push to flatten, and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2-like manipulator folds a small pink cloth lying on a wooden table. The robot first perceives the cloth, approaches from above, and aligns. It forms a pinch grasp on an edge, lifts the edge, and translates laterally to fold the cloth onto itself. It then lowers until contact with the table, releases the grasp, optionally applies a short push to flatten the fold, and retreats clear of the workspace. The sequence aims to be gentle and precise to avoid wrinkling or slipping.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear and reachable", "Cloth is visible on the table", "Gripper operational and empty", "Table surface provides sufficient friction"],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Detect the cloth and move above it at safe clearance.",
      "Align precisely and open the gripper.",
      "Compute a pinch grasp on a cloth edge and pick.",
      "Lift slightly and translate laterally to fold.",
      "Lower until contact, release, then push briefly to flatten.",
      "Retreat from the workspace."
    ],
    "success_criteria": ["Cloth appears halved with edges aligned", "Cloth remains stationary after release", "Gripper ends empty and above table"],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Detection fails → retry detection up to 3 times.",
      "Grasp slips → re-align and re-grasp after opening.",
      "Cloth drags excessively → reduce lateral distance or reattempt with smaller lift.",
      "Contact not detected → extend lowering depth within safe bounds."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate when the gripper has released the cloth, optional flattening push is complete, and the arm has retreated."
