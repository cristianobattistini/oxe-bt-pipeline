    "overview": "A PR2 arm operates on a tabletop with a small plate on the left and a bread-like item on the right. The robot must localize the bread, plan a pinch grasp, approach precisely, grasp it, and transfer it over the plate. After positioning above the plate, it places the bread at the center and retreats to a safe pose. Visual feedback drives re-detection if targets are not visible. Motions use moderate timeouts and gentle press force to avoid deforming the food item.",
