    "overview": "A PR2 end-effector operates on a tabletop with a green mat. A white plate and a piece of bread/pastry are visible. The goal is to pick the bread and ultimately situate it on the plate, consistent with the visual sequence. The robot first perceives the bread, aligns for a pinch grasp, establishes contact, closes the gripper, verifies the grasp, lifts away from the table, moves above the plate, and performs a gentle placement before retreating to a safe pose.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Bread and plate are within reachable workspace",
