  "task_summary": "Fold a pink cloth on a tabletop by pushing along its edge after approaching and making gentle contact.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 arm must fold a pink cloth lying on a wooden tabletop. The arm first ensures the cloth is visible, approaches above it, aligns the end-effector, and orients the gripper for an edge push. It lowers until contact and executes a directed push to create a fold. After the push, the arm pauses to stabilize the cloth and then retreats. The sequence uses perception fallback with retries and conservative motions suitable for soft, deformable objects.",

    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Verify cloth visibility or scan to locate it",

      "Push along cloth edge to fold it",
      "Pause briefly to settle fabric",
      "Retreat to a safe height/position"
    ],
    "success_criteria": ["A visible overlap indicating a fold", "No object other than cloth displaced", "Robot ends clear of the cloth"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If cloth not visible, rescan with retries", "If contact not detected, re-approach and lower again", "If push slips, reorient yaw and attempt a shorter push"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the push completes and the arm has retreated to a safe distance."
