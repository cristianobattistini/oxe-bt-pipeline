  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 end-effector operates over a tabletop with a plate and a grape cluster. The goal is to pick a grape (visually a small cluster) using a gentle pinch grasp. The robot first ensures visual contact, plans a grasp, aligns carefully, then closes the gripper with low force to avoid crushing. After securing the grasp, it lifts a short distance and retreats to a safe pose. Frames indicate approach over the plate and a post-grasp lift/retreat motion.",
