  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 manipulator must pick a small bread piece from the table and place it onto a nearby white plate. The sequence begins with visual detection of both bread and plate, followed by opening the gripper, moving above the bread, computing a pinch grasp, and aligning precisely. After grasping, the arm transfers above the plate, lowers until contact is detected, releases the bread, and retreats. Movements are time-bounded and precise to avoid knocking the plate or the bread off the desired area.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot and camera calibrated", "Workspace clear except bread and plate", "Gripper operational and empty", "Plate is stable on the table"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect bread and plate", "Open gripper", "Move above bread", "Compute grasp and align", "Pick bread", "Move above plate", "Lower until contact", "Open gripper to release", "Retreat"],
    "success_criteria": ["Bread securely grasped without slip", "Bread placed centered on the plate area", "No collisions with plate or table", "Gripper retreats clear of objects"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, retry perception or scan", "If grasp unstable, re-open and recompute grasp", "If contact not detected over plate, re-approach from above", "If release fails, open gripper again and slightly raise"],
    "termination": "Terminate when bread is released on plate and the arm has retreated."
