  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The scene shows a PR2 gripper operating over a green mat with a small white plate. A bread-like item is near the gripper and ends centered on the plate. The behavior coordinates perception of the plate, a controlled approach from above, gentle lowering until contact with the dish, release with an appropriate gripper width, and a safe retreat. Constraints include stable alignment to avoid knocking the plate and a gentle touchdown before opening the gripper to prevent bouncing.",
