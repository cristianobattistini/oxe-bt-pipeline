  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 arm operates above a tabletop with a white plate and a small bunch of grapes. The goal is to pick the grapes from the table and place them onto the plate. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, precise approach, a stable grasp suitable for small deformable objects, safe vertical lift, gentle placement near the plate center, and a clean retreat to avoid disturbing the placed item.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is homed with reachable workspace over table.", "Camera view includes table area with plate and grapes.", "Gripper operational and empty.", "No human in workspace."],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect grapes and plate.", "Pre-open gripper.", "Move above grapes and align precisely.", "Compute a pinch grasp pose.", "Execute pick and verify grasp stability.", "Move above the plate with clearance.", "Lower until gentle contact.", "Release grapes on plate.", "Retreat upward."],
    "success_criteria": ["Grapes securely grasped before transfer.", "Grapes released onto plate area.", "No collisions with plate edge or table.", "Gripper retreats safely."],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If perception fails, re-run DetectObject.", "If grasp is unstable, re-open, re-approach, and recompute grasp.", "If contact occurs too early while lowering, retreat slightly and reattempt placement."],
    "termination": "Tree succeeds when grapes are released on the plate and the arm has retreated."
