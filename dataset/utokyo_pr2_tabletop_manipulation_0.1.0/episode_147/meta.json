  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2-like manipulator folds a pink cloth lying on a tabletop. The robot first localizes the cloth, approaches from above, orients its tool to match the cloth edge, and achieves light contact. Instead of a lift-and-place grasp, the fold is induced by two short pushes along a diagonal to flip part of the cloth over itself. The sequence emphasizes alignment, gentle contact, and repeatable short motions to form a crease before retreating to a safe height. The arm operates with an open gripper, using contact and planar pushing to realize the fold.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cloth is present on the table within reachable workspace",
      "No objects obstruct the approach path",
      "End-effector is free; gripper can open",

      "Lower until gentle contact with the table/cloth.",
      "Execute two short diagonal pushes with brief pauses to form a crease.",
      "Retreat to clear the workspace."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Visible crease with part of the cloth folded over itself",
      "Robot ends clear of the cloth without disturbing the final fold",
      "No collision except intentional low-force contact"

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Perception failure: retry detection (built-in Retry).",
      "Misalignment: re-approach and realign before pushing.",

      "Excessive slip: reduce push distance or adjust yaw, then retry."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after retreat once the fold is formed and no further actions are required."
