  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2-like manipulator folds a pink square cloth on a wooden tabletop. The robot pinches one edge, lifts the corner, reorients the wrist to align the fold, transports the grabbed edge across a nominal fold line, and lays it down to create a crease. Frames show approach, grasp, lift, transport, and placement. The sequence must be time-bounded with gentle motions near contact. Symbolic targets (cloth_edge_A, fold_line_pose, fold_place_pose) represent visual-servoed poses estimated online.",
    "preconditions": [

      "Yaw the tool, lift, and transport towards the fold line.",
      "Lower to table, press/place to form crease.",
      "Release and retreat a safe distance."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Cloth remains on table with one half folded over the other",
      "No object slippage during transfer",

      "If detection fails, rescan or adjust viewpoint.",

      "If contact not detected while lowering, increase depth slightly and retry."
