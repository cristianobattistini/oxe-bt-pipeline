  "task_summary": "Fold the pink cloth on the tabletop by approaching, contacting gently, pushing to create a fold, and retreating.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 arm folds a pink cloth lying on a wooden table. The robot first perceives the cloth, approaches above it, aligns, and lowers until contact. It orients the tool and performs a short push along the cloth edge to create a fold, then retreats and pauses. The sequence avoids grasping and relies on controlled contact and planar pushing, consistent with the frames showing a slide-based fold.",
    "preconditions": ["Cloth is on the table within workspace", "End-effector free and above table", "Camera provides view of cloth", "Table surface dry and unobstructed"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect the cloth", "Move above the cloth", "Align with cloth orientation", "Lower until contact is detected", "Orient tool to 90° yaw", "Push along the cloth edge to fold", "Retreat to a safe height", "Brief wait to stabilize"],
    "success_criteria": ["Cloth appears folded into a smaller rectangle", "No collisions with table beyond gentle contact", "Robot retreats to safe pose"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Object not detected → retry perception or scan", "Contact not achieved → lower slightly again", "Over-push causing misfold → reduce push distance and reattempt", "Slip or snag → retreat, realign, and re-push"],
    "termination": "Terminate after retreat and stabilization wait once the cloth is folded."
