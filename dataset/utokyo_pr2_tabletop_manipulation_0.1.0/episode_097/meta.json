  "task_summary": "Perceive a pink cloth, grasp one corner with a gentle pinch, lift slightly, and place it over the center to achieve a single fold, then release and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2-style manipulator folds a pink cloth lying flat on a wooden tabletop. The robot must first detect the cloth, align its gripper to a corner, and grasp gently to avoid dragging. After establishing a stable grasp, it lifts a small distance and places the corner onto a target pose near the cloth center to create a fold. Orientation control ensures the gripper approaches from the side. The sequence prioritizes precise alignment, low force, and short, safe motions, ending with release and retreat for clear post-task visibility.",
    "preconditions": ["Cloth is visible on table", "Robot has workspace access from right side", "Gripper operational and empty", "No obstacles near the cloth"],

      "Detect the cloth and confirm visibility.",

      "Lift slightly to avoid friction.",
      "Create or retrieve a fold target pose near the cloth center.",
      "Place the corner at the fold pose, then release.",
      "Retreat to a safe distance."
    ],
    "success_criteria": ["Cloth shows a clear overlapping fold", "No excessive cloth displacement aside from the fold", "Gripper releases cleanly", "End-effector retreats without contact"],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Perception failure: re-detect the cloth or adjust view.",
      "Misalignment: re-approach and realign before grasp.",
      "Weak grasp/slippage: reopen, recompute grasp, and retry.",
      "Placement off-target: re-place using the stored fold pose."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful place, gripper open, and retreat completed."
