  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 arm manipulates a pink cloth on a wooden tabletop. The goal is to create a single, neat fold by grasping one edge, performing a small lift to reduce friction, and pulling the grasped edge across the cloth before lowering to form a crease. The sequence emphasizes reliable perception, gentle grasping, and controlled end-effector motion. The robot should end with the cloth folded and the gripper open, clear of the workspace, while avoiding excessive forces that might shift the cloth unpredictably.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cloth visible on table and within reach",

      "Lift slightly and translate along the table to fold.",
      "Lower until contact to crease, release the cloth, and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Cloth shows a clear single fold (double layer visible)",
      "Gripper is empty and open",
      "End-effector has retreated from the folded cloth",

      "Insufficient fold: repeat the translate and lower steps",
      "Over-dragging: retreat slightly and re-align before re-folding"
    ],
    "termination": "After releasing the cloth and retreating to a safe distance with no errors reported."
