  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The PR2 arm operates over a wooden tabletop with a pink cloth. The robot first ensures the cloth is visible and localized, then opens the gripper and computes a pinch grasp on an edge. After approaching and aligning, it picks the edge, lifts slightly, moves to a fold anchor, lowers to the table to constrain the cloth, and performs a directional push to fold the material. Finally, it releases the cloth and retreats, leaving a tidier, folded square. The behavior emphasizes gentle contact, alignment precision, and table-aided manipulation.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cloth is on the table within reachable workspace",
      "Camera view unobstructed for detection",
      "Gripper functional and calibrated",

      "Lift slightly and move toward a fold anchor area.",
      "Lower until contact and push the edge across to fold.",
      "Open gripper to release and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Cloth appears folded into a smaller, neater shape",
      "No slipping object in gripper before release",
      "End-effector safely clear after retreat"

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If cloth not visible, rescan using raster pattern",
      "If grasp unstable, recompute grasp and retry pick",
      "If push misfolds, repeat push from a corrected start pose"
