  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 arm folds a pink cloth on a tabletop by pushing rather than pinching, consistent with the frames that show approach, contact, a sustained push, and retreat. The behavior starts with scanning and detection, then moves above the cloth, aligns to an edge, lowers until contact, and performs a directional push to crease the fabric. After the push, the system records a folded state and retreats to a safe height. Constraints include conservative timeouts, precise alignment, and gentle contact forces suitable for fabric.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear except for the cloth", "Camera provides a top view for detection", "Gripper is open and safe to make contact", "Table frame and push direction are defined"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Scan and detect the cloth", "Move above the cloth and set end-effector yaw", "Approach and align to an edge", "Lower until contact at low force", "Push along a direction to create a fold", "Record fold state to blackboard", "Retreat to a safe distance"],
    "success_criteria": ["Cloth shows a crease or reduced footprint after push", "No object slips during contact", "Robot retreats to safe standoff", "Blackboard marks fold_state=creased"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Cloth not detected → rescan with raster pattern", "Misalignment → re-run ApproachAndAlign", "Insufficient contact → repeat LowerUntilContact", "Push stalls → retreat slightly and retry push with same direction"],
    "termination": "Tree terminates after fold_state is set and a safe retreat is achieved."
