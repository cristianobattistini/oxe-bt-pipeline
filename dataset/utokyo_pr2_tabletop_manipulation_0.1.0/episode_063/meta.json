    "overview": "A PR2 end-effector interacts with a grape cluster and a white plate on a wooden tabletop. The robot must perceive the grape, approach with a safe pregrasp, compute a pinch grasp, align precisely, and pick. After verifying a stable grasp, it transfers above the plate, performs a gentle place, opens the gripper to release the grapes onto the plate, and retreats to a safe height. Timeouts and precise alignment ensure reliable execution despite perception noise and small object geometry.",
