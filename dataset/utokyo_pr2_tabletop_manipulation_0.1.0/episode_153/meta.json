  "task_summary": "Detect the pink cloth, approach and make gentle contact near an edge, then push to fold it over itself, pause to settle, and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A single-arm manipulator must fold a pink cloth on a tabletop. The robot first ensures the cloth is visible; if not, it scans the workspace. With the gripper opened, it moves above the cloth, aligns to the edge, and lowers until contact is detected. Using the end-effector, it performs a directed push along the surface to flip part of the cloth over, forming a fold. After a short wait to let the cloth settle, the arm retreats to a safe position. The sequence prioritizes precise alignment and gentle contact suitable for deformable objects.",
