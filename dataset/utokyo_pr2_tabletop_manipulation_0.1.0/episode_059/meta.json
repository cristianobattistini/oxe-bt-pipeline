  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 end-effector must pick a grape positioned near a reflective round plate on a tabletop. The robot first ensures visual detection, then moves to a safe pre-grasp height and computes a pinch grasp pose. It opens, aligns precisely, lowers until contact, closes with low force, and executes a pick. After verifying a stable grasp, it retreats upward to clear the workspace. The contact sheet shows progressive approach, alignment over the grape, closure, and lift-off.",
