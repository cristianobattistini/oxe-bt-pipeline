  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 end-effector operates over a green tablecloth with a white oval plate and a small bread piece to its right. The sequence shows approach from the right, contact, a lateral push moving the bread onto the plate, and a retreat. The behavior favors push-based placement over grasping, matching the visual evidence. Key constraints include keeping motion planar, modest timeouts, and a short retreat to clear the field of view for verification.",

    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect bread", "Detect plate", "Move above bread at small height", "Orient tool yaw for lateral push", "Align to bread edge", "Push bread left toward plate", "Re-detect bread on plate", "Retreat slightly", "Wait briefly"],
    "success_criteria": ["Bread ends resting on the plate", "No object in gripper after task", "Robot safely clear from plate at end"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, rescan; if alignment off, re-approach; if push insufficient, repeat push; if collision risk, retreat and reorient"],
    "termination": "Terminate after verification detects bread_on_plate and the arm has retreated and waited."
