  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2-style manipulator must pick a piece of bread from the right side of a tabletop and place it onto a small white plate positioned to the left on a green mat. The robot first perceives the bread, approaches from above with a pinch grasp, aligns precisely, and performs a pick. With the bread secured, it transfers above the plate, gently lowers until contact, releases the bread on the plate, and retreats. The scene includes a plate, bread, and a flat workspace; careful positioning and gentle placement are important.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear except for a plate and a bread piece", "Gripper operational and initially open", "Camera provides sufficient view of bread and plate", "Plate is stable on the mat"],

    "success_criteria": ["Bread ends resting on the plate surface", "No bread slippage during transfer", "Robot safely retreats without collisions"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Bread not detected -> rescan area with raster pattern", "Failed grasp -> recompute grasp and retry", "Early contact when placing -> retreat slightly and reattempt lowering", "Bread dropped in transit -> re-detect and re-pick if visible"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the bread is released on the plate and the arm has retreated to a safe distance."
