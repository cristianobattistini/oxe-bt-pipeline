  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A PR2 end-effector manipulates a pink cloth on a wooden tabletop. The goal is to fold the cloth by pinching a corner, lifting slightly, translating to a fold location, and pressing the corner down before releasing. The sequence must be gentle to avoid slipping. Visual confirmation and alignment precede the grasp; thereafter, the robot lifts minimally, repositions, and places the corner with light contact. The scene features a single cloth and clear workspace; timing and tolerances are moderate.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cloth is on the table within reachable workspace",
      "Camera view provides sufficient visibility of the cloth",
      "Gripper is functional and empty",
      "Fold target pose is defined on the blackboard"
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Perceive the cloth and move above it.",
      "Align precisely and open the gripper.",
      "Compute a pinch grasp at a corner and pick.",
      "Lift slightly and move to the fold preparation pose.",
      "Place at the fold pose with a 90Â° yaw and light press.",
      "Release the cloth and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Corner of cloth is placed onto the cloth body forming a visible fold",
      "No slippage during or after release",
      "Gripper ends clear of the workspace"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails: re-detect from a new vantage.",
      "If grasp slips: reopen, realign with tighter tolerance, and retry pick.",
      "If contact not detected during press: lower again within safe limits."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after release and retreat once the fold is stable and no object remains in the gripper."
