  "task_summary": "Perceive a pink cloth, approach and make gentle contact, then push to fold it and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A single robotic arm manipulates a small pink cloth on a wooden tabletop. The goal is to fold the cloth by making contact and pushing one section over itself, resulting in a smaller, neatly folded rectangle. The sequence emphasizes perception, cautious approach, contact detection, a directed push along the fold line, short settling time, and a safe retreat. No grasping is used; folding is performed via contact and pushing. Constraints include low force during contact and accurate alignment to avoid dragging the cloth off the workspace.",
    "preconditions": ["Cloth is on the table within reachable workspace", "Camera view of the cloth is available", "Arm and gripper are unobstructed", "Table surface is dry and provides moderate friction"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Open gripper to avoid snagging", "Detect the cloth", "Move above the cloth at a safe height", "Lower slowly until contact is detected", "Push along the intended fold direction to fold the cloth", "Pause briefly to allow the cloth to settle", "Retreat to a safe standoff"],
    "success_criteria": ["Cloth appears folded into a smaller rectangle", "Cloth remains on the table within workspace", "No object collisions", "Arm retreats to a safe position"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception fails: re-detect the cloth", "Contact not detected: re-approach and lower again", "Push misaligned: re-approach and attempt a shorter push", "Cloth slips: reduce push distance and retry"],
    "termination": "Terminate after the retreat step completes and the cloth remains stably folded."
