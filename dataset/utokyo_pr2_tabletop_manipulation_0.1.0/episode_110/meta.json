  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The PR2 arm manipulates a small pink cloth on a wooden tabletop. The goal is to fold the cloth by contacting near its midline and pushing in a straight direction to create a crease, then smoothing the fold briefly before withdrawing. The sequence emphasizes reliable perception, gentle contact, an orientation suitable for a straight-line fold, and a short stabilization pause before retreat. The gripper remains open, using the end-effector surface to press/slide rather than grasp.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace clear with cloth visible on table",
      "Robot reachable workspace above cloth",
      "Gripper operational and can remain open",

      "Detect the cloth and verify visibility; re-scan if not visible.",
      "Open gripper and move above the cloth with a small clearance.",

      "Align tool yaw for a straight fold direction.",
      "Push along a line to fold one side over.",
      "Optionally wipe along the seam to sharpen the fold.",
      "Wait briefly to let fabric settle.",
      "Retreat to a safe height."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Cloth appears folded into a smaller rectangle",
      "No excessive wrinkling or displacement off workspace",
      "Robot ends in a safe, retracted pose"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If cloth not detected: raster scan then retry detection.",
      "If contact not detected: repeat lower-with-contact step.",
      "If fold slips or direction is off: repeat push with corrected yaw.",
      "If fabric bunches: perform an extra wipe pass."
