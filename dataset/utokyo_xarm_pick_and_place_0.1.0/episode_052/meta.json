    "overview": "A fixed camera observes a tabletop with a red plate and a white plate. The robot arm must pick up the white plate and place it onto the red plate. The sequence opens with perception, approaches from above for a top grasp, verifies grasp stability, transfers the object to the red plate region, lowers until contact, opens the gripper to place, and retreats to a safe height. Timing, forces, and tolerances are discretized to the allowed bins to ensure safe, repeatable execution.",
