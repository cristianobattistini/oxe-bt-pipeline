    "overview": "The scene shows a tabletop workspace with a robotic arm interacting with a white plate and a nearby red plate, implying a pick-and-place sequence where the white plate must be lifted and set down on the red plate surface [attached_file:1]. The contact sheet frames illustrate approach, contact, lift attempt, and movement toward the red plate region, supporting a standard top grasp followed by a careful placement [attached_file:1]. The plan emphasizes reliable perception, stable grasp verification, gentle seating via contact detection, and a short retreat to clear the workspace after release [attached_file:1].",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is homed with a functional gripper and reachable workspace around both plates [attached_file:1]",
      "White plate and red plate are present and unobstructed on the table [attached_file:1]",

      "Open the gripper and confirm or actively scan until the white plate is visible [attached_file:1]",
      "Detect and localize the white plate, compute a top grasp, and move to a pregrasp height [attached_file:1]",
      "Align precisely, execute the grasp, verify stability, and confirm the object is in the gripper [attached_file:1]",
      "Move above the red plate, descend until contact, release the plate, and retreat to a safe standoff [attached_file:1]"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "White plate is released such that it rests supported by the red plate with no slip during retreat [attached_file:1]",
      "End effector is clear of both plates with gripper open after placement [attached_file:1]"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If the plate is not detected, perform spiral scanning retries before aborting [attached_file:1]",
      "If grasp is unstable, re-open, recompute grasp, and attempt a second alignment and pick [attached_file:1]"
