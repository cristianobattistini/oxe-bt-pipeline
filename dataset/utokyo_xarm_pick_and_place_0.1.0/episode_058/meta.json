    "overview": "A 6-DoF xArm interacts with tabletop dishes. The objective is to pick a white plate from the workspace and place it centered on a red plate. The tree performs perception to find both plates, approaches above the white plate, computes a pinch-style grasp, executes the grasp, validates stability, navigates above the red plate, lowers until contact, places with a gentle press, releases, and retreats. Motions are time-binned and tolerances are tight to avoid slipping on smooth ceramics.",
