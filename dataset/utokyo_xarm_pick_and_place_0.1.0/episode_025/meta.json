    "overview": "A stationary xArm with a parallel-jaw gripper operates over a tabletop with a red plate and a separate white plate. The robot must perceive the scene, approach the white plate from above with precise alignment, compute a grasp, and pick it. After verifying a stable grasp, it moves above the red plate and performs a controlled placement with gentle contact before releasing. Frames show approach, grasp, transfer, placement onto the red plate, and final retreat. No obstacles other than the table surface are visible.",
