    "overview": "A fixed-base xArm with a parallel gripper must perform a pick-and-place: locate a white plate on a green table, grasp it from the top, and then place it accurately onto a nearby red plate/tray visible in multiple frames. The behavior addresses perception uncertainties by falling back to a scan if visibility checks fail, uses a computed top grasp, and applies a gentle, contact-based placement before releasing. The sequence concludes with a short retreat and wait to ensure stability and clearance around the placed item.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is powered, homed, and gripper operational",
      "Workspace contains a white plate and a red plate within reachable area",

      "Detect the red plate, set a target place pose, approach, and descend until contact",
      "Press to seat the plate, release, retreat, and pause briefly"

    "success_criteria": [
      "White plate lifted securely without slipping",
