  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator must pick a white ceramic plate placed on the tabletop and place it onto a nearby red plate target. The scene shows the arm approaching from above with a parallel gripper. The plan uses visual detection for both plates, a top grasp of the white plate, and a gentle placement on the red plate center. Motions favor tight alignment before grasp, moderate timeouts, and a brief press at placement, followed by gripper release and retreat to clear the workspace.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear around both plates",
