    "overview": "A fixed manipulator must relocate a white plate onto a nearby red plate. The scene shows a table with both plates visible and the robot approaching from above with a parallel gripper. The robot first perceives the white plate, aligns for a side grasp at the rim, picks it up, and then transfers to a pose above the red plate. It descends gently until contact is detected, opens the gripper to place the plate, and finally retreats to a safe height. Timing values are binned and motions are conservative to avoid sliding.",
