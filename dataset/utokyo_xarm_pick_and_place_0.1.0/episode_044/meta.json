    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a parallel gripper must relocate a white plate onto a nearby red plate. The contact sheet shows approach to the white plate, side grasp, transport toward the red plate, release above the red surface, and a final retreat. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, gentle but secure grasping, and alignment before release. Timeouts and tolerances use conservative bins. No container operations are required; placement is achieved by opening the gripper once alignment over the red plate is verified.",
