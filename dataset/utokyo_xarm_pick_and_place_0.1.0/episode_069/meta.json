    "overview": "A stationary manipulator with a parallel gripper must pick up a white plate resting on a tabletop and place it on a nearby red plate. The scene shows both plates on a green work surface with ample clearance. The robot should approach from above, align precisely, close the gripper to secure the plate, lift, transit toward the red plate, descend until contact with the support, release gently, and retreat to a safe height.",

    "success_criteria": ["White plate is released centered on or overlapping the red plate", "No object slip during transfer", "End-effector retreats to a safe pose"],
