    "overview": "A tabletop xArm manipulator must relocate a white plate onto a red plate. The scene shows a green workspace with a shallow white plate near center-right and a red plate at the lower-left. The robot should approach the white plate, align precisely, compute a top grasp, pick it, transfer it toward the red plateâ€™s area, descend until contact, open the gripper to place, and then retreat to a safe pose. Motions should be deliberate to avoid tipping the plate.",
