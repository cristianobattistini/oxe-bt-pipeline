    "overview": "A single-arm manipulator must move a white plate onto a nearby red plate. The scene shows both plates on a flat green work surface with the gripper approaching, grasping, transferring, and releasing. The robot should first ensure the white plate is visible, prepare the gripper, compute a grasp (suction), approach with tight alignment, perform a stable pick, localize the red plate, and finally place the white plate gently on top before retreating. The plan emphasizes reliable perception, careful approach, and low-speed contact during placement.",
    "preconditions": [
      "White plate and red plate are within reachable workspace",

      "White plate is released resting on the red plate",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "White plate not detected → scan pattern search and retry perception",
      "Grasp fails or slips → recompute grasp and retry pick",
      "Misalignment over red plate → re-approach and re-align before placing",
      "Premature contact → retreat slightly and attempt a gentler placement"
