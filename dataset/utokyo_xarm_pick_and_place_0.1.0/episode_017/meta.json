    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator must relocate a white plate onto a nearby red plate. The scene shows both plates on a tabletop with sufficient clearance for top-down grasping. The robot first localizes the white plate, opens its gripper, approaches above, computes a pinch grasp, aligns, and executes the pick. After verifying stability, it lifts, navigates above the red plate, executes a placing motion with gentle press, releases, and retreats, leaving the white plate centered on the red plate.",
