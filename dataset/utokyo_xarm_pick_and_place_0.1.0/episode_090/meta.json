  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The task involves a robotic arm manipulating two plates in a laboratory environment. The robot must detect and grasp a white circular plate, then precisely place it onto a red circular plate. The workspace contains a green surface with both plates initially separated. The task requires careful object detection, grasp planning, and placement control to avoid damaging the plates or missing the target location.",
    "preconditions": ["Both white and red plates are visible and accessible", "Robot arm is in safe starting position", "Gripper is operational and properly calibrated", "Workspace is clear of obstacles"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect white plate location", "Plan grasp approach for white plate", "Move to white plate and align gripper", "Open gripper to appropriate width", "Execute pick operation on white plate", "Move above red plate with clearance", "Plan placement pose relative to red plate", "Lower and place white plate onto red plate", "Retreat to safe position"],
    "success_criteria": ["White plate is successfully grasped without slipping", "White plate is placed stably on red plate", "Plates are aligned concentrically or acceptably overlapped", "No collision or damage occurs during manipulation"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, retry scan with different camera angles", "If grasp fails, retry with adjusted gripper pose", "If placement misses target, retry with refined pose computation"],
    "termination": "Task completes when white plate is stably placed on red plate and robot retreats to safe position"
