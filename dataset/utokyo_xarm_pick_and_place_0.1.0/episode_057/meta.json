    "overview": "A stationary xArm manipulator must pick a white plate from the tabletop and place it onto a nearby red plate/disc. The contact sheet shows approach to the white plate, grasping near its rim/top, transfer toward the red plate, placement, and retreat. The tree uses perception to localize both plates, a top grasp strategy, precise alignment before grasping, and a cautious descent with contact detection before releasing. Timeouts are moderate to tolerate minor delays, and a short wait after retreat stabilizes the scene.",
