  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows an xArm with a parallel gripper operating near two dishes: a white plate and a red plate. The goal is to pick up the white plate and place it onto the red plate. The behavior tree first ensures both targets are detected, computes a top grasp for the white plate, approaches precisely, and performs a pick. The robot then repositions above the red plate, descends until contact to avoid sliding, executes the placement with light press, opens the gripper, and retreats to clear the stack.",
