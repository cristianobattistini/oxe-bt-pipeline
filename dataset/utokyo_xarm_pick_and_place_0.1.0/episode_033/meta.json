    "overview": "A 6-DoF robotic arm with a parallel gripper operates on a tabletop containing a red plate and a white plate. The robot must first perceive the white plate, approach it from above, align precisely, compute a grasp, and pick it up. It then transfers the grasped plate toward the red plate, aligns above the red plate, lowers until contact, releases the plate, and retreats to a safe height. Visual confirmation and contact cues guide the placement while avoiding collisions and slippage.",
