    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows an xArm manipulator, a white plate and a red plate on a green surface. The robot must grasp the white plate and place it onto the red plate. The plan uses perception to locate both plates, a top grasp for the white plate, and a gentle placement with a short press after contact. Motions include moving above approach poses, aligning before grasp, transferring the held plate over the red plate, lowering until contact, and releasing.",

    "success_criteria": ["White plate securely grasped before transfer", "White plate placed stably on red plate", "No collisions with table or environment", "Gripper fully releases object"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception miss: rescan target", "Grasp slip: reopen and retry pick", "Contact not detected on place: lower again within limits", "Placement misalignment: lift slightly and re-align"],
