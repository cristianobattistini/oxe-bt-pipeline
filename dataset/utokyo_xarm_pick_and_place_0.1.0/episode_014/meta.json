    "overview": "A stationary manipulator with a parallel gripper must grasp a white plate from the tabletop and place it onto a nearby red plate. The contact sheet shows the arm approaching, aligning, making contact, closing the gripper, lifting, moving toward the red plate, descending, releasing, and retreating. Motions should be precise and gentle to avoid sliding the plates. Visual detection initializes targets; cautious vertical motions manage contact forces.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot powered and homed; workspace clear",
      "White plate visible and reachable",

      "Detect and move above the red plate.",
      "Lower onto the red plate and release.",
      "Retreat to a safe height."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "White plate is stably placed on top of the red plate",

      "If object not detected: retry detection or adjust view",

      "If grasp unstable: reopen, realign, and regrasp",
      "If placement misaligned: lift slightly, re-approach, and reseat"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful release and retreat, or after safety timeout/failure condition."
