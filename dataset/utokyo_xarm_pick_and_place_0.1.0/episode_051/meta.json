  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A 6-DoF robotic arm with a parallel gripper must pick up a white plate from a tabletop and place it onto a nearby red plate. The contact sheet shows approach, alignment, grasp, lift, transit toward the red plate, lowering to contact, release, and retreat. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, stable grasping, gentle touchdown, and a short post-place retreat to avoid collisions with dishes.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear around both plates", "Robot is homed and gripper functional", "White and red plates are on the table and visible or discoverable"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Perceive the white plate", "Open gripper and approach above the white plate", "Align and compute grasp", "Pick and verify grasp stability", "Lift/retreat slightly", "Perceive the red plate and move above it", "Lower until contact with the red plate surface", "Open gripper to place", "Retreat to a safe height"],
    "success_criteria": ["White plate is released centered on the red plate", "No collisions with the environment", "Gripper empty at end", "Robot safely cleared from the dishes"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If perception fails, scan the workspace", "If grasp unstable, reattempt pick after minor re-alignment", "If contact not detected while placing, lower a bit more within safe depth, else abort"],
    "termination": "Task ends after successful placement and final retreat or after an unrecoverable failure."
