  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A 6-DOF xArm with a parallel-jaw gripper must pick up a white plate visible on the mat and place it onto a red plate located to the left. The sequence includes perception of both plates, a precise approach and rim pinch grasp of the white plate, transport toward the red plate, gentle placement with surface contact detection, release, and retreat. Frames show approach, tilt/secure grasp of the white plate, and a subsequent move toward the red plate area.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is homed and within workspace limits",
      "White plate and red plate are on the mat and within view",

      "Detect red plate; move above it.",
      "Lower until contact with surface; open gripper to release.",
      "Retreat and wait briefly."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "White plate securely grasped (no slip during transport)",
      "White plate placed centered on the red plate with contact established",
      "Robot retreats to a safe height without collisions"

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Perception failure → scan pattern and retry detection",
      "Grasp slip → re-align and recompute grasp",
      "Contact not detected → lower again within max depth, else abort",
      "Placement misalignment → re-detect red plate and re-attempt"
    ],
    "termination": "Task ends after successful release on the red plate and safe retreat."
