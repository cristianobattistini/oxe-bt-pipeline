  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A 6-DoF arm with a parallel gripper operates on a tabletop. The goal is to pick a white plate and place it on a nearby red plate/tray. The contact sheet shows approach, grasp, lift/transfer, and a likely placement near the red surface. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception of both targets, precise alignment before grasping, gentle contact while placing, and a short retreat to clear the workspace.",
    "preconditions": [

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Perception miss → retry detection up to 3 times",
      "Minor misalignment → repeat approach/alignment",
      "No contact sensed while lowering → abort place and re-scan",
      "Unstable grasp → re-open, regrasp"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful release on the red plate and retreat, or after retries are exhausted."
