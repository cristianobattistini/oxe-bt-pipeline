    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a parallel gripper operates on a tabletop with a white plate and a red plate. The goal is to pick up the white plate and place it centered on the red plate. The sequence includes perception, approach, grasping with a top strategy, transferring to the red plate region, gentle contact-based placing, release, and retreat. Movements stay above the table except during controlled descent. Actions use bounded timeouts and tight alignment tolerance suitable for dishware.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot powered, calibrated, and workspace cleared",
