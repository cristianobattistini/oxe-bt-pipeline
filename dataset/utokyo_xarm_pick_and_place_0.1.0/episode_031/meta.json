  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A 6-DOF arm with a parallel gripper operates over a green mat containing a white plate and a red circular target plate. The robot must perceive the white plate, approach with a top grasp, align precisely, pick the plate, transfer toward the red plate, lower until contact, place it gently, release, and retreat. The contact sheet shows approach, contact, and post-manipulation frames, with cables and workspace boundaries visible. The plan assumes unobstructed motion and stable grasp.",
