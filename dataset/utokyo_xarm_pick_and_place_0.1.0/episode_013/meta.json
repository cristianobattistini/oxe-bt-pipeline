    "overview": "A fixed-base xArm must grasp a shallow white plate from the table and place it accurately on top of a red plate target. The scene shows both plates on a green tabletop with ample clearance. The behavior prioritizes reliable perception, careful approach, stable grasp, safe transfer, and gentle placement with a brief press and release, followed by retreat to a safe height. Timing values are binned; motions use an above-target waypoint to avoid collisions.",

      "Move above the red plate, lower until contact, press and place.",
      "Open gripper to release and retreat to a safe distance."

      "White plate lifted securely without slip",
