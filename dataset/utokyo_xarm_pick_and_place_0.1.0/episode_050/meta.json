  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "An xArm manipulator must grasp a shallow white plate lying on a green mat and place it onto a red plate target. The contact sheet shows approach, grasp, lift, transfer toward the red plate, a controlled descent to contact, release, and retreat. The gripper begins empty. The plan prioritizes reliable perception of both plates, a top grasp, gentle vertical approach/retreat motions, and a low-speed, contact-based placement to avoid sliding.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Gripper is empty and opened",
      "White plate and red plate visible in workspace",
      "No obstacles between robot and plates",
      "Robot is homed and reachable poses are collision-free"

      "Open gripper and detect the white plate.",
      "Move above the white plate, compute a top grasp, align and pick.",
      "Verify grasp stability and lift/retreat.",
      "Detect the red plate and move above it.",
      "Align over the red plate, descend slowly until contact.",
      "Open gripper to release the white plate onto the red plate.",
      "Retreat to a safe height."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "White plate is released on top of the red plate surface",
      "No drop or excessive sliding during placement",
      "Robot retreats clear of objects with gripper open"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If object not visible: re-detect target and reattempt approach",
      "If grasp unstable: reopen, recompute grasp, repeat pick",
      "If no contact detected while lowering: abort descent, re-align and try again"
    ],
    "termination": "Task terminates after successful release on the red plate and final retreat."
