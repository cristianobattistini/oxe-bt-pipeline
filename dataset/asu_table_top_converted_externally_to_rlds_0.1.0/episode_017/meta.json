    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates over a small white table with several objects: two green bottles, a blue can, an orange figure, a small cup on the right, and a maroon square/rectangular block near the center. The goal is to move the maroon square without grasping. The robot first detects the target, moves to a safe height above it, precisely aligns, performs a lateral push to translate the block, and finally retreats to clear the workspace.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot initialized with collision-free workspace.",
      "Maroon square visible on the table surface.",
      "No obstacles in the intended push path to the left ~10 cm.",

      "Detect the maroon square on the table.",

      "Refine approach and align with tight tolerance.",
      "Push the maroon square left by approximately 10 cm.",
      "Retreat to a safe standoff position."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Maroon square translated laterally by at least 8–10 cm.",
      "No collisions with other objects.",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails, rescan the area or adjust viewpoint.",
      "If alignment times out, repeat approach with relaxed tolerance.",
      "If push stalls due to obstruction, reduce distance or change direction slightly.",
      "If unintended contact occurs, retreat and re-approach."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful push and retreat, or after unrecoverable detection/alignment failure."
