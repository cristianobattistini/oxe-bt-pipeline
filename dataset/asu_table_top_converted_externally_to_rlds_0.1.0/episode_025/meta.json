    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator places a small red soda can onto a white tabletop. The scene shows multiple objects (green bottle, tall red bottle, blue can, gray cup, orange stack). The gripper appears to hold the red can during the approach. The behavior aligns above the placement area, lowers until contact, releases the can, and retreats to a safe height. Timing and forces are kept moderate; precise lateral alignment is used to avoid collisions with nearby objects.",
