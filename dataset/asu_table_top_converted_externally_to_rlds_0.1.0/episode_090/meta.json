  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed manipulator above a white tabletop must raise a small red can visible among bottles, cups, and caps. The tree first ensures perception of the can, computes a side grasp, approaches from above with a small alignment tolerance, executes the grasp, verifies stability, lifts the can by ten centimeters, holds briefly, and retreats. The scene shows a UR-type arm, the red can near left-center, with potential occlusions by nearby items. Motions are time-binned and forces unspecified; lifting distance is modest to avoid collisions with surrounding objects.",

    "success_criteria": ["Red can is securely grasped", "Can is lifted off the table without collisions", "Gripper holds can steadily for at least 1 s", "Robot retreats to a safe clearance"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, rescan the area", "If pose key missing, recompute grasp pose", "If grasp unstable, reopen gripper, slightly realign, and retry", "If lift meets resistance, stop and retreat to avoid collisions"],
    "termination": "Terminate after retreating with the can successfully lifted and held for the specified duration"
