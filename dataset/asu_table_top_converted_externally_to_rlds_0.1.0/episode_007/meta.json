  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates over a tabletop with multiple small containers and bottles. The goal is to raise the white carton briefly off the surface. The behavior starts by ensuring the target is visible, then computes a top grasp, aligns, grasps, verifies grasp stability, and lifts the carton to a safe height. Timeouts are conservative to avoid long stalls. Precision alignment is used before grasping to reduce slip on the rectangular carton.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is homed and within reachable workspace of the table",
      "White carton present on table, not occluded beyond recoverable scanning",

      "Execute grasp and close gripper",
      "Verify grasp stability",
      "Raise the held carton by 0.15 m and hold briefly"

      "Carton securely in gripper",

      "If grasp not stable: abort lift and re-attempt from alignment step",
      "If timeouts occur: report failure and wait for operator"
    ],
    "termination": "Tree succeeds after lift and hold complete; it fails on unrecoverable perception or grasp errors."
