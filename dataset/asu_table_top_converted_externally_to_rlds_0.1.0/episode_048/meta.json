  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A table-top manipulation scene features several objects (red cup, blue can, green glass bottle, orange items, and a small white carton at the right). The robot must locate the white carton, align for a top grasp, securely grasp it, and raise it a short distance above the table to demonstrate lifting. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, alignment with tight tolerance, and post-grasp stability before lifting. A short retreat clears the workspace after the raise.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot initialized over the table", "White carton present within reachable workspace", "Camera/pose estimation available", "Gripper functional and empty"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Perceive the white carton or perform a short scan", "Open gripper and move to a pregrasp above the carton", "Align with tight tolerance and set yaw", "Compute grasp pose (top) and execute grasp with pinch", "Verify grasp stability", "Raise the held carton by 0.15 m", "Retreat slightly"],
    "success_criteria": ["Carton lifted at least 0.10 m above tabletop", "Object remains stably in gripper (no slip)", "No collision with nearby objects", "Robot ends in a safe, non-interfering pose"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If object not visible: perform scan and re-detect", "If grasp fails/slips: reopen, recompute grasp, and retry", "If alignment fails: re-approach with same tolerance"],
    "termination": "Terminate once the raise and retreat succeed with a stable grasp."
