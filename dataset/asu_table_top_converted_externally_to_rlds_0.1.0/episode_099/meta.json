  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates over a cluttered white tabletop with bottles, cans, and a tan bread-like item. The goal is to put the bread down on the table surface. The robot verifies the bread is in the gripper, moves to a safe height above the table, aligns, lowers until contact is detected, opens the gripper to release, and retreats to avoid collisions. Timing and forces are conservative to avoid knocking nearby objects.",
    "preconditions": ["Bread is already grasped in the gripper", "Table surface area is available for placement", "Camera and kinematics calibrated", "No human interference in workspace"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Confirm bread is in gripper", "Move above a table placement region", "Initiate placement routine onto table surface", "Lower until contact at low force threshold", "Open gripper to release bread", "Retreat to a safe distance"],
    "success_criteria": ["Bread rests stably on table", "No secondary objects displaced significantly", "Gripper fully released and clear of bread", "Robot ends in a collision-free retreat pose"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If object not detected in gripper, abort placement and signal pick sequence", "If contact not sensed in time, retry lowering once with same thresholds", "If release fails, re-open gripper and slightly lift then retry"],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful retreat following a confirmed release."
