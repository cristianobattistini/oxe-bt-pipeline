  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A stationary robotic arm interacts with several small tabletop items, including bottles, cans, and a small white carton. The goal is to locate the white carton, grasp it reliably, lift it clear of nearby objects, and place it onto a designated safe area on the same table. The behavior prioritizes reliable perception, a side grasp suited to the cartonâ€™s shape, and gentle placement. The sequence is linear and conservative, using a verification step for grasp stability and a tolerance-bounded placement with minimal press force.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is homed and reachable workspace includes the white carton", "Table surface is stable and free of large obstacles at the target place area", "Gripper operational and calibrated width settings available", "Perception pipeline can detect 'white_carton' symbolically"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Scan and detect the white carton on the table", "Approach and align to a side grasp, opening the gripper in advance", "Compute a grasp pose and execute the grasp", "Close gripper and verify grasp stability", "Raise the held carton to avoid collisions", "Place the carton on the table using a low-press placement with tolerance", "Release the object and retreat"],
    "success_criteria": ["White carton ends resting on the table target area and is not in the gripper", "No collisions with other objects or the table during motion", "Grasp is achieved without dropping during transfer"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, rescan the area and retry alignment", "If grasp is unstable, reopen, recompute grasp, and attempt again", "If place area is occupied, choose a nearby free spot on the table and re-place"],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful place and retreat or after exceeding internal retries/timeouts."
