    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene shows several small objects arranged on a white table: a blue can near the center-right, a green bottle, a red block, a silver can, and two orange items. The robot arm must pick the blue can. The plan detects the target, approaches from above, aligns precisely, opens the gripper, computes a grasp pose, executes a side grasp, closes with moderate force, lifts to verify grasp stability, and checks that the object is in the gripper.",
