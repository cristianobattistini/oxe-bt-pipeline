  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style robotic arm must raise a maroon square block placed on a semicircular white table among other distractor items (green and blue bottles, a red can, a gray cup, and orange stacked cylinders). The robot opens the gripper, perceives the maroon square, approaches from above, computes a top grasp, verifies the grasp pose is available, grasps, and lifts the object several centimeters. The final posture holds the object stably in the air to demonstrate the raise action.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is homed and within reach of the table.", "Maroon square is visible on the table.", "Gripper is functional and can open to 0.08 m.", "Workspace is free of obstacles above the target."],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Open gripper.", "Detect maroon_square with retries.", "Move above the target with small vertical offset.", "Approach and align precisely.", "Compute top grasp for maroon_square.", "Verify grasp pose availability.", "Execute grasp at computed pose.", "Close gripper with moderate force.", "Raise the held object vertically by 0.10 m.", "Hold briefly to confirm success."],
    "success_criteria": ["Object is in gripper (stable hold).", "Object is visibly off the table by ~0.10 m.", "No collision with neighboring items.", "Action completes within allotted timeouts."],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception failure → retry DetectObject up to 3 times.", "Pose not available → recompute grasp pose.", "Slip during lift → lower, re-grasp, and retry.", "Collision imminent → abort raise and retreat."],
    "termination": "Terminate after the object is successfully lifted and held for the specified duration."
