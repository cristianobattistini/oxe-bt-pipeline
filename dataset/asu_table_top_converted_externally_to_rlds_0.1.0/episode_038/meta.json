  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates above a small tabletop with several bottles/cans and a small white box near the right edge. The goal is to position the end-effector over the intended place area, gently lower until contact with the table, place the white box, open the gripper to release, and back away without disturbing nearby objects. The sequence assumes the box is already grasped at the start and prioritizes collision-free, low-force placement on the right-side pad.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot has the white_box securely grasped", "Target place area (place_pad) is visible and reachable", "Workspace is clear of dynamic obstacles"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect or confirm the place area (place_pad)", "Verify the object is in the gripper", "Move above the placement spot with a small vertical offset", "Lower until gentle contact with table is detected", "Execute place down action for the white_box", "Open gripper to release", "Retreat straight back by a short distance"],
    "success_criteria": ["White box is resting stably on the table within the place area", "No collisions with nearby objects", "Gripper fully released and robot retreated to a safe standoff"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If place area not detected, rescan or adjust viewpoint", "If contact not detected within depth limit, retry lower with slightly increased depth", "If release fails, reopen gripper and perform a slight lift-replace cycle"],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful release and retreat to the specified distance"
