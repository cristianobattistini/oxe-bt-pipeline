    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator interacts with several tabletop items (red can, blue can, snack stack, green bottle, translucent cup, purple cup). The goal is to handle the red container and place it down on the table. The behavior first perceives and aligns to the object, computes a grasp, grasps it with a pinch strategy, lifts to clear neighbors, then gently places it onto the table before retreating.",
