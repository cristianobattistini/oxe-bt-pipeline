  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base robotic arm must push a milk box (white rectangular carton) on a tabletop. The scene includes multiple distractor objects: cans, a green bottle, a red prism, and a small pastry on the left. The robot first perceives the milk box, approaches and aligns its end effector, sets a neutral yaw, executes a straight push along the table, then retreats and pauses briefly. No grasp is required; motion should avoid toppling nearby objects or pushing the carton off the table.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot powered and homed", "Workspace clear of unexpected obstacles", "End effector suitable for planar pushing", "Milk box present and visible on the right side of the table"],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Detect the target milk box.",
      "Approach and align to establish a straight push path.",
      "Set tool yaw to neutral for planar contact.",
      "Push the milk box along the table to the right.",
      "Retreat from contact and wait briefly."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Milk box translates on the tabletop by the commanded distance without tipping.",
      "No collision with non-target objects.",
      "Robot ends in a safe, non-contact pose."

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If the milk box is not detected, re-scan or adjust viewpoint.",
      "If alignment drifts, re-run ApproachAndAlign before pushing.",
      "If push stalls due to friction or obstruction, reduce contact point or repeat with a slightly longer distance."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after the push completes, the robot retreats, and a short wait elapses."
