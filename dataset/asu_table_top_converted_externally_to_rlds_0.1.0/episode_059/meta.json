  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm operates over a cluttered tabletop holding a small white milk box. The goal is to put the milk box down onto the table near other objects (cups, bottles, can) without disturbing them. The behavior moves above the placement pose, aligns, lowers until contact, opens the gripper to release, and retreats to clear the object. Timeouts and gentle contact thresholds ensure safe placement among distractors.",
    "preconditions": ["Milk box is already in the gripper", "Tabletop placement area is reachable", "Gripper can open to release object", "Perception sufficient to reference the table placement pose"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Verify the robot is holding the milk box", "Move above the table placement pose with vertical clearance", "Approach and align to the target pose on the table", "Lower until contact is detected with a low force threshold", "Open the gripper to release the milk box", "Retreat upward to avoid collisions"],
    "success_criteria": ["Milk box stands stably on the table", "No collision with other items", "Gripper released and robot retreated to a safe standoff"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If not holding the box, abort or switch to a pick subroutine", "If alignment fails, re-approach and realign", "If contact not detected, increase max_depth slightly then retry", "If release fails, reopen gripper and gently wiggle or re-lower"],
    "termination": "Task ends after retreat completes and the object is no longer in the gripper."
