  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator interacts with several tabletop objects (bottles, cans, a red cup, and a light/white carton-like object). The goal is to push the white carton without grasping it. The robot must first perceive and localize the target, then approach and align its end-effector to ensure a straight push, execute a 10 cm push to the right, and finally retreat to clear the workspace. Timing and tolerances are modest to balance reliability and speed.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear of unexpected obstacles along the push path.", "White carton is on the table and visible to the camera.", "Robot is homed and gripper open."],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Perceive: detect 'white_carton'.", "Approach and align to the face intended for pushing (tolerance 0.02).", "Execute Push for 0.10 m at 90Â° direction.", "Retreat 0.10 m to disengage."],
    "success_criteria": ["White carton translates approximately 10 cm along the intended direction.", "No grasping occurs; motion is a surface push.", "Robot retreats without collisions."],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, retry detection up to 3 times.", "If alignment error exceeds tolerance, re-approach.", "If push stalls due to collision, abort and retreat."],
    "termination": "Behavior ends after retreat completes or after repeated detection failure."
