    "overview": "A fixed-base robot arm operates over a white tabletop with several objects, including a green glass bottle, a red bottle, a blue can, and stacked orange cylinders. The goal is to place down the green glass bottle in a clear table region visible in later frames. The behavior tree first localizes the target, prepares the gripper, plans a side grasp, verifies the computed pose, grasps, lifts, transfers to a safe placement zone, lowers and places the bottle, releases it, and retreats. Timeouts, distances and forces are snapped to allowed bins for safety and repeatability.",

      "Green glass bottle visible on the table",
