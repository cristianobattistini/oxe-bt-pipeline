    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates over a curved white table containing multiple small objects: cans, bottles, a pink cylinder, and a small white carton on the right side. The goal is to raise the white carton vertically off the surface. The robot must perceive the target, approach from above, compute a top grasp, close the gripper, confirm possession, lift by a short distance, briefly stabilize the hold, and retreat slightly to clear the workspace.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is homed and within reach of the tabletop.",
      "White carton is present and unobstructed.",

      "Raise the held carton by 10 cm.",
      "Hold/stabilize for 1 s and retreat 5 cm."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "White carton is securely in the gripper.",
      "Object is lifted approximately 10 cm above the table without dropping.",
      "Robot retreats slightly while holding the object."

      "Perception failure: re-run detection and small viewpoint adjustment.",
