  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates on a tabletop with bottles, cans, and small blocks. The instruction is to raise a maroon square. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, careful approach with tight alignment, a top grasp, and a controlled vertical lift to clearly separate the object from the surface. After lifting, the robot holds position to verify stability and then retreats to avoid collisions. The plan assumes the maroon square is the flat, dark-red block visible near the tableâ€™s center-left in multiple frames.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear of obstacles above the maroon square",

      "Raise the held maroon square by 0.15 m.",
      "Hold briefly to check stability, then retreat."

    "success_criteria": [
      "Maroon square is securely in the gripper",
