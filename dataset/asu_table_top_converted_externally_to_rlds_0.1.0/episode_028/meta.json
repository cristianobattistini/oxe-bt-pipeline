    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates over a white table with several items (bottles, cans, blocks). The goal is to place down the brown/orange object visible on the right side of the workspace. The tree first verifies whether the object is already in the gripper; otherwise it performs a quick detectâ€“grasp routine. After confirming a stable grasp, the arm moves above the table, executes a low-force surface placement, opens the gripper to release, then retreats to clear the object and avoid collisions.",
