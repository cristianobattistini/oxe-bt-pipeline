  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator works on a white tabletop with multiple objects aligned near the table edge: a green bottle, a clear cup, a red cuboid, a small can, stacked orange cups, and a blue can. The instruction asks to push a bottle. Visual evidence shows the end-effector approaching the green bottle from its right side and executing a lateral push without grasping. The behavior prioritizes perception, approach and alignment, yaw adjustment for side contact, a short controlled push, and a small retreat to clear the object.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear of obstacles along the push direction.", "Bottle is on the table and visible to perception.", "Gripper/tip suitable for non-grasp pushing.", "Controller limits allow lateral contact motion."],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect the green bottle.", "Approach and align to the bottle with modest tolerance.", "Set end-effector yaw to present a flat pushing face.", "Execute a lateral push of 0.15 m (approx.) toward the left.", "Retreat 0.10 m to clear the object after motion."],
    "success_criteria": ["Bottle translates along the tabletop in the commanded direction by roughly the push distance.", "No grasp occurs; contact is sliding.", "Robot remains within workspace limits with no collisions.", "End-effector retreats to a safe pose after the push."],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Object not detected → retry perception/adjust view.", "Misalignment causes slip → re-approach and re-align, then re-push.", "Insufficient motion due to friction → repeat push or increase distance.", "Unexpected contact force → abort push and retreat."],
    "termination": "Terminate when the push completes and the robot has retreated to a safe clearance."
