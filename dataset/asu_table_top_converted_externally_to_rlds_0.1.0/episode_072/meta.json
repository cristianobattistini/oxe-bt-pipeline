    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates over a white table with several small bottles, cans, and cups; the most carton-like milk item is a beige cylindrical bottle near the center-right, so the plan targets this as the milk container surrogate. The robot opens the gripper, localizes the target, approaches from above, computes a side grasp, closes to secure, lifts, verifies hold, and retreats to clear the clutter. Visual evidence indicates cluttered neighbors including a red can and blue cups, requiring precise alignment. [attached_file:1]",
