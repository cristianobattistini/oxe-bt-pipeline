    "overview": "A UR-type manipulator must pick up a maroon cube from a cluttered tabletop scene. Objects include bottles, cans, a white carton, and orange rings. The robot opens the gripper, detects the cube, aligns from above, computes a top-down grasp, closes the gripper, verifies stability, and lifts the object. Movements should avoid nearby items and maintain sufficient clearance above the table.",
