    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator on a white tabletop must hold the Coke item. The scene shows multiple objects: a red Coke can at the left, a blue can, a green plastic bottle, three small orange bottles, and a tall red bottle at the right. The robot should perceive the target, approach from above, compute a grasp, close the gripper, verify stability, and hold for a short duration. Movements should avoid disturbing nearby items while maintaining alignment.",
