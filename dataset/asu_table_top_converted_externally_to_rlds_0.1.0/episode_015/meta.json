  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator must move a small green bottle on a white table populated by multiple colored objects (red block, orange item, purple/blue bottles). The behavior executes perception, grasp planning, grasp execution, a short lift and transfer, and a compliant place on the table. The object is referred to as \"green_bottle\". Timing and forces are binned to safe values. If the object is not initially visible, a short scan is performed before detection and grasp planning.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is homed and table area is reachable.",

      "Verify grasp stability and raise the held object slightly.",
      "Move to the target table pose and place at the preset 'place_on_table'.",
      "Release and retreat."

    "success_criteria": [
      "Green bottle ends on the table without toppling.",
