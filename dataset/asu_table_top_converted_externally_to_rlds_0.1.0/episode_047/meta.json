  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm must put down a green glass bottle visible among other tabletop objects (red can, blue bottle, orange cups). The robot likely already holds the bottle and needs to deposit it onto the table surface near the other items. The behavior emphasizes a controlled descent until contact, gentle placement with modest press force, and a safe retreat to avoid collisions with nearby objects.",

      "Place the held bottle on the table with neutral yaw.",
      "Open the gripper to release the bottle.",
      "Retreat vertically to clear the object."

      "Bottle ends upright and stably resting on the table surface",
