  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm operates over a cluttered tabletop containing a green bottle, a small blue bottle, a red bottle, a silver can, orange cups, and a gray cup. The robot localizes the blue bottle, approaches from above, computes a top grasp, closes the gripper, verifies the grasp, lifts the object slightly, and retreats to clear the workspace. Visual scanning is used if the object is not immediately detected. The sequence emphasizes reliable perception and a stable grasp before lifting.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is powered and homed", "Workspace is reachable", "Gripper operational and empty at start", "Blue bottle present on the table"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Open gripper", "Detect/scan for blue bottle", "Move above with clearance", "Align end-effector and compute top grasp", "Execute grasp and close gripper", "Verify object in gripper", "Lift slightly", "Retreat and hold briefly"],
    "success_criteria": ["Blue bottle securely in gripper", "Object lifted without collisions", "Robot retreats to a safe offset"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If object not visible, perform spiral scan then detect", "If grasp fails, reopen gripper and retry perception-approach sequence", "If contact or collision risk detected, retreat and re-approach"],
    "termination": "End after retreat and a short hold/wait period."
