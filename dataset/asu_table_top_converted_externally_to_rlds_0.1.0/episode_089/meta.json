  "task_summary": "Detect the green bottle on the right side of the table, approach and align the end-effector, then push it laterally and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A stationary manipulator must push a green bottle resting on a tabletop among several other objects (red cylinder, blue can, orange items, small cubes). The arm begins near the table center and moves toward the right side where the green bottle sits close to the edge. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, safe approach above the surface, alignment before contact, and a controlled push followed by a short retreat to clear the object.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is homed and within workspace limits", "Table surface is clear around the push path", "Green bottle is present and visible or discoverable by scan", "Gripper is open for non-grasp contact"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Open gripper", "Verify visibility of the green bottle or scan to locate it", "Move to a safe height above the target", "Approach and align to a side-contact pose", "Execute a lateral push of fixed distance", "Retreat to a safe clearance pose", "Brief wait to stabilize"],
    "success_criteria": ["Bottle exhibits displacement in commanded direction", "No collisions with non-target objects beyond incidental contact", "Robot retreats to a safe distance after push"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If target not visible, scan again (retry)", "If approach/align times out, re-perceive and re-approach", "If push stalls, re-align then push once more (future enhancement)"],
    "termination": "Terminate after a single successful push and retreat sequence."
