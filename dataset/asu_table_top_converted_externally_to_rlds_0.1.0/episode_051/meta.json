  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene shows multiple small objects (cans, bottles, a cup) arranged in a row. The robot arm must pick the Coca-Cola can (red cylinder). The behavior first ensures the gripper is open, detects and centers on the target, then computes a side grasp suitable for a parallel two-finger gripper. After executing the grasp, it closes with moderate force, lifts the can a short distance to confirm clearance, checks that the object is indeed in the gripper, and retreats to a safe height/offset to end in a stable state.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot reachable workspace includes the Coca-Cola can.",
      "Camera view contains the can with sufficient contrast.",

      "Open gripper and visually detect 'cocacola_can'.",

      "Close gripper, raise held object slightly.",
      "Verify object in gripper and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Coca-Cola can is firmly in the gripper.",
      "Can is lifted from the table without collision.",
      "Robot retreats to a safe pose with can held."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails, retry detection up to three times.",
      "If alignment or grasp fails, re-detect and re-attempt.",
      "If object slips after lift, reopen, re-plan grasp, and try again."
    ],
    "termination": "Tree succeeds when 'ObjectInGripper' is true after lifting and the retreat completes."
