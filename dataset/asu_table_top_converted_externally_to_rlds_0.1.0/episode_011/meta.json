  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a parallel gripper must pick the blue bottle from a cluttered tabletop containing multiple colored bottles/cups. The behavior first perceives and localizes the blue bottle, computes a feasible grasp, approaches from above with small tolerance, executes a pinch grasp, verifies the grasp, and lifts the object to a safe height. Timeouts and forces are conservatively chosen to avoid collisions with nearby objects.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Blue bottle is on the table and visible within workspace",

      "Approach and align precisely to the bottle.",
      "Execute grasp at goal_pose with pinch strategy.",
      "Close gripper with moderate force.",
      "Verify the object is in the gripper.",
      "Lift the object vertically to clear surrounding items.",
      "Check grasp stability."

      "ObjectInGripper condition becomes true",
      "Lifted at least 0.10 m without collision",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails, re-run detection.",
      "If approach times out, retreat slightly and re-approach.",
