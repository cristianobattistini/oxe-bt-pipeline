  "task_summary": "Detect, grasp, and lift the bread object from the table. After a stable grasp, raise it about 10 cm, hold briefly, then retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-arm manipulator must lift a bread item from a cluttered tabletop containing bottles, a can, and a small cube. The robot first perceives the bread, approaches above it with a small alignment tolerance, computes a top grasp, closes the gripper, verifies grasp stability, then raises the held bread vertically to clear the surface. It holds the object momentarily for verification and retreats to avoid collisions. No placement is required; the goal is a clean lift and hold.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Bread object is on the table within reachable workspace",
      "Gripper is empty and operational",
      "Camera can see the table; lighting adequate",

      "Raise the held bread vertically by 0.10 m.",
      "Hold for 1 s and retreat slightly from the scene."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Bread is securely in the gripper (no slip).",
      "Vertical clearance of approximately 0.10 m above table achieved.",
      "No collisions with neighboring objects or the table.",
      "Robot retreats to a safe posture after lift."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails, re-acquire view and re-run detection.",
      "If alignment fails, re-approach with smaller tolerance.",
      "If grasp is unstable, reopen, recompute grasp pose, and retry.",
      "If lift meets resistance, stop and reassess collision/clearance."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after a stable grasp, successful raise, 1 s hold, and retreat completed."
