    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates over a white table with multiple small containers and bottles. The green bottle is the moving target. The robot aligns to the bottle, secures a grasp, lifts, translates toward a free area on the right side, lowers until table contact, and opens the gripper to put the bottle down, then retreats. Motions should be gentle and collision-free given clutter around other cans and cups.",

      "If contact not detected within depth limit, abort lowering and re-approach.",
      "If release fails, reopen gripper and retry."
