    "overview": "A UR-style arm on a tabletop must move a small brown/orange block among other colored items (green bottle, red can, pink cup, etc.). The safest strategy, consistent with the frames, is to push the brown object laterally instead of grasping it. The behavior first guarantees visual contact, aligns the TCP to the object, performs a short push to translate it, and then retreats to clear the scene. Timeouts and distances are modest to avoid disturbing neighboring objects.",
