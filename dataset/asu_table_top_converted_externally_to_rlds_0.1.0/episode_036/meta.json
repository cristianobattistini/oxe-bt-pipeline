    "overview": "A tabletop scene with multiple colored containers is manipulated by a robotic arm. The goal is to hold the blue bottle located on the right side of the table. The robot first perceives the target, prepares by opening the gripper, aligns to the bottle for a side grasp, executes the pick, and then holds the object for a fixed duration to demonstrate a stable grasp. Movements are conservative and precise to avoid disturbing nearby items.",
