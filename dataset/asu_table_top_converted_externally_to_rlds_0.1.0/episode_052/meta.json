  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator must locate a small maroon cube on a cluttered white tabletop and pick it up. Nearby distractors include bottles/cans (green, blue, red) and orange cups. The robot should first perceive the cube, approach above it, refine alignment, compute a top grasp, close the gripper, and lift the cube safely off the surface. Movements should avoid collisions with other objects and keep timeouts modest to reflect a quick tabletop manipulation.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is homed and reachable workspace includes the cube", "Table surface is static and clear of obstacles near the cube", "Gripper functioning and initially open", "Perception returns a pose for 'maroon_cube'"],

      "Open gripper.",
      "Detect maroon cube.",
      "Move above the cube with a small vertical offset.",

      "Compute grasp pose (top strategy) and execute grasp at that pose.",
      "Close gripper with moderate force.",
      "Raise the held cube by 0.10 m to confirm pickup."
    ],
    "success_criteria": ["Cube secured between fingers (no slippage)", "Cube lifted at least 0.10 m above table", "No collisions with other objects"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Object not detected → rescan or adjust lighting/pose", "Misalignment during approach → re-align with tighter tolerance", "Grasp slip → reopen and retry top grasp with slightly higher force"],
    "termination": "Terminate once the cube is lifted and maintained in a stable hold."
