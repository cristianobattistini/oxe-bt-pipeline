  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator interacts with small tabletop items. The target is a red square block initially near the right-rear of the table. The robot must perceive the block, approach precisely, grasp it with moderate force, lift, move toward a free area at the front-right, lower until gentle contact with the table, release, and back off. Other distractor objects include a green bottle, cans, and two small orange figures. The plan emphasizes controlled approach, verified grasp, safe descent, and a short retreat to avoid collisions.",
