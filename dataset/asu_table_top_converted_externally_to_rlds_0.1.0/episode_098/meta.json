  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator must place a white box onto the table. The object appears among cans and bottles on a curved tabletop. The robot is assumed to already be holding the white box. The behavior ensures a controlled approach above the placement zone, a gentle press to seat the object, gripper release, and a short retreat to avoid collisions. Timeouts and minimum press force are conservative to prevent knocking nearby items.",
    "preconditions": [
      "White box is grasped and stable in the gripper",
      "Table area has enough free space to place the object",
      "Robot reachable workspace includes the target area",
      "Perception provides a nominal place region on the table"
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Verify the object is in the gripper.",
      "Move to a pose above the table placement region.",
      "Place on surface with low force and nominal yaw.",
      "Open gripper to release the box.",
      "Retreat vertically to clear the object."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "White box rests stably on the table without sliding",
      "No collisions with nearby cans/bottles",
      "Gripper fully releases the object",
      "End-effector returns to a clear, safe pose"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If object not detected in gripper: abort and request a pick routine",
      "If contact is unstable or obstruction occurs: retreat and reattempt placement",
      "If release fails: reopen gripper and gently jiggle by re-placing with minimal force"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful placement and retreat to a safe distance."
