  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed robotic arm must pick a small bread-like item from a cluttered tabletop. The scene shows multiple distractor objects (bottles, cans, cups) around the center zone. The robot should first detect and localize the bread, open the gripper, move above and align precisely, then close the gripper to grasp. After checking grasp stability, it lifts the item slightly to verify the pick while avoiding collisions with neighbors. No placement is required; the task ends after a successful lift with the bread in the gripper.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is homed and reachable workspace includes the bread.", "Vision system can detect the 'bread' target.", "Gripper operational and unobstructed."],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect the bread.", "Open gripper.", "Move above the bread with small vertical offset.", "Approach and align with tight tolerance.", "Close gripper to grasp.", "Check grasp stability.", "Raise held object slightly to confirm pick."],

    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, re-run perception.", "If alignment fails, back off and retry alignment.", "If grasp unstable, reopen, re-approach, and regrasp."],
    "termination": "Terminate once the bread is confirmed in the gripper after a small lift."
