  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene shows several small bottles/cans and a robot arm over a white table. The goal is to pick up the red can. The robot must first localize the can, open its gripper, align to a safe grasp pose, close the gripper to secure contact, and lift the can clear of the surface. Visual detection may require a short scan if the can is not initially visible. The plan prioritizes stable grasp verification before lifting and a brief hold after the lift to confirm success.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot is homed and reachable workspace includes the red can",

      "Execute the grasp at the computed pose and close the gripper.",
      "Verify grasp stability, then lift the can.",

    "success_criteria": [
      "Red can is securely held by the gripper",
