    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator must pick a red upright object situated among several cans and bottles on a curved white tabletop. The robot first perceives the target, opens its gripper, moves to a safe height above the object, aligns top-down, computes a grasp, executes the grasp, verifies that the object is held, and lifts it slightly to confirm pickup. The sequence assumes unobstructed access from above and uses conservative timeouts and moderate gripping force to avoid knocking nearby items.",
