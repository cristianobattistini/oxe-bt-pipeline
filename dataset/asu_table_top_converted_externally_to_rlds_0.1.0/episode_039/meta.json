  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm operates above a tabletop with several objects: a tall maroon block near the left, an orange stack, small cans (blue, silver, red), and a green bottle to the right. The goal is to push the maroon object along the table surface. The behavior tree first ensures the object is perceived (or scans if not), then aligns the end-effector, performs a straight push with moderate travel, and finally retreats to avoid interference with nearby items.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace clear of unexpected obstacles",
      "Maroon object rests on table within reachable workspace",

      "If the maroon object is not visible, scan to acquire it.",
      "Approach and align the TCP to the object with tight tolerance.",

      "Retreat to a safe standoff."

      "Maroon object translates on the table approximately the commanded distance",

      "If object not visible: perform scan routine",
      "If alignment fails: re-run approach after scan on next tick",
      "If push stalls due to friction: shorter reattempt after retreat could be triggered in a higher-level loop"

    "termination": "Task terminates after retreat completes following a successful push or after tree failure if perception or approach cannot succeed."
