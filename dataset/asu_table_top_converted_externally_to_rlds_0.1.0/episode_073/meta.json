  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator must pick up a small bread/loaf item from a cluttered tabletop. The scene includes bottles, cups, and cans. The robot first perceives the bread, verifies visibility, prepares the gripper, and approaches from above with tight alignment. It computes a grasp pose, executes a pinch-style grasp, confirms the object is secured, then lifts and slightly retreats to clear the clutter. No placement is required; success is achieved when the bread is stably held above the surface.",
