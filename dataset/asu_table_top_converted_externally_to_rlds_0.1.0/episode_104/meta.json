  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A stationary manipulator must pick up the slender green glass bottle from a cluttered tabletop and hold it steadily for a few seconds. The scene shows multiple colorful containers, with the arm approaching from above and the bottle located right-of-center. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, precise alignment, a side grasp around the bottleâ€™s neck or body, and a brief hold after lifting to verify stability.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is homed and table workspace is reachable", "Gripper is functional and initially open", "Bottle is within camera field of view or can be found by scanning", "No safety interlocks are active"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Check visibility or scan for the green glass bottle", "Detect and localize the bottle precisely", "Open the gripper and move to a safe pregrasp above the bottle", "Approach and align with tight tolerance", "Compute a side grasp pose and verify the pose is available", "Execute grasp and close gripper", "Lift slightly and hold for the requested duration"],
    "success_criteria": ["Bottle detected and localized", "Gripper closes with stable purchase", "Bottle lifted off the surface without collision", "Hold maintained for the full duration without slip"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If the bottle is not visible, perform a spiral scan", "If grasp fails, re-detect and recompute grasp pose", "If slip is detected, re-align and re-grasp", "If approach alignment times out, retreat and retry"],
    "termination": "The task ends when the bottle has been lifted and held steadily for the configured duration without errors."
