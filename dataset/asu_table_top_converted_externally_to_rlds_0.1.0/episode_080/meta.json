    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene shows several small items arranged in a row: cans, bottles, and a central brown item. The robot arm must identify the brown object, approach from above, compute a top grasp, close the gripper to secure it, and then lift and hold it steadily. Timing and force parameters are chosen from allowed bins to ensure safe interaction and a reliable hold without placing the object down.",

      "Raise the held object and maintain a hold for the requested duration."
