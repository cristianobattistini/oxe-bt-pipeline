  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene shows several bottles, cans, and small blocks. The goal is to pick up the brown object visible toward the left side of the workspace. The arm should open the gripper, approach from above, align precisely, compute a top grasp, and close to secure the item. After confirming a stable grasp, the robot lifts the object a short distance, holds it, and retreats to clear the workspace. No placement is required; only a reliable pickup and lift are necessary.",

      "Brown object is present on the table and within reachable workspace",
