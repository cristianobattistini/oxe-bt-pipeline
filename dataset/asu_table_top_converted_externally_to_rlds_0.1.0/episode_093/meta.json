    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator must pick up a coke can visible on a white tabletop among distractor objects (green bottle, blue can, clear cups, small figurines). The robot first perceives the target, prepares the gripper, moves above the can, aligns for a safe top/side grasp, closes the gripper to secure the can, verifies stability, and lifts the can slightly off the table to confirm a successful pick. Motion and grasp are time-bounded and use conservative tolerances to avoid collisions with nearby objects.",
