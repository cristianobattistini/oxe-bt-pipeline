  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A table-top manipulator must pick up a piece of bread from a cluttered scene that includes cans, bottles and cups. The robot first perceives and localizes the bread, then moves above and aligns to it. A top-style grasp pose is computed, the gripper closes to secure the item, and the robot lifts slightly to clear the table. The behavior confirms the object is in the gripper and holds briefly to stabilize. No placement is requested; the task ends after a successful lift-and-hold.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is homed and reachable workspace includes the table.", "Gripper operational and empty.", "Bread is present on the table and not occluded beyond detection thresholds."],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect bread.", "Open gripper.", "Move above the bread and align.", "Compute a top grasp pose.", "Execute grasp and close gripper.", "Check grasp stability.", "Raise the held object slightly.", "Verify object-in-gripper and hold briefly."],
    "success_criteria": ["Bread lifted off the table by at least 0.1 m.", "ObjectInGripper condition true.", "Hold completes without slip or drop."],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, retry up to three times.", "If grasp fails or is unstable, the sequence will not progress; operator may relaunch with adjusted parameters.", "If lift fails due to collisions, retreat and re-approach (not encoded)."],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful hold following a verified lift, or if detection repeatedly fails."
