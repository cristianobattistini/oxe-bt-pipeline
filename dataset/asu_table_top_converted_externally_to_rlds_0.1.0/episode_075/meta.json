  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates over a cluttered tabletop with cans, bottles, and small blocks. The goal is to place down the maroon square block. The robot first localizes the block, computes a top grasp, secures it, lifts slightly, moves to a safe placement over the table surface, and performs a gentle place with low press force. After releasing, it retreats to avoid collisions and stabilize the scene.",

    "success_criteria": ["Maroon square rests stably on the tabletop", "Gripper is open and empty at end", "No collisions with nearby objects", "Final pose shows object no longer in gripper"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Detection failure → re-detect from a slightly different view", "Unstable grasp or slip → re-compute grasp and retry", "Placement misalignment → lower slowly, adjust, and re-place", "Unexpected contact → retreat, re-approach and try again"],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful release and brief wait, or on repeated timeouts/failures."
