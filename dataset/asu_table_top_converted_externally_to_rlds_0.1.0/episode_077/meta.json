  "task_summary": "Detect the red Coke can and push it left along the table surface, then retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator must push the red Coke can across a tabletop cluttered with other items (green bottle, blue can, orange stack, red bottle, gray cup). The gripper is used as a pusher: open, align to the can, set yaw to face the intended push direction, and execute a short linear push while avoiding collisions. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, alignment, and controlled surface interaction rather than grasping.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace clear of major obstacles near the push path", "Camera view of the Coke can available", "Robot within its reachable workspace", "Table surface flat and non-slippery enough for controlled push"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect Coke can", "Move above pre-push pose", "Open gripper to use as pusher", "Approach and align to can within 1 cm tolerance", "Set tool yaw to 270° for leftward push", "Push can 0.15 m toward left", "Retreat 0.10 m to clear"],
    "success_criteria": ["Coke can displaced roughly 15 cm in intended leftward direction", "No toppling of non-target objects", "Robot ends safely clear of objects"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, reattempt perception or small scan", "If alignment drifts, re-approach and realign", "If collision occurs, stop, retreat slightly, and retry with smaller distance"],
    "termination": "Terminate after the push completes and the robot retreats to a safe clearance."
