  "task_summary": "Detect, grasp, raise, and maintain a hold on the blue Pepsi bottle.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A table-top scene shows several bottles and small containers. The robot arm must find the Pepsi bottle (blue, positioned to the right in most frames), approach it with an open gripper, execute a side grasp, verify that the object is secured, lift it slightly, and keep holding it for a short duration. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception with a scan fallback and a bounded number of retries, followed by a precise approach and stable grasp suitable for a cylindrical plastic bottle.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear of unexpected obstacles", "Pepsi bottle is present on the table", "Robot is homed and gripper operational"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Perceive the Pepsi bottle; if initial detection fails, perform a spiral scan", "Open the gripper", "Approach and align to the bottle within 1 cm tolerance", "Execute a standard side grasp", "Verify the object is in the gripper", "Raise the held bottle 0.10 m", "Hold for 2 s"],
    "success_criteria": ["Bottle successfully grasped and lifted off the table", "Object remains in gripper for the hold duration", "No collisions or drops observed"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, the scan fallback is used", "If grasp fails or is unstable, the sequence is retried up to 3 times", "If object slips after lift, reopen, re-align, and reattempt"],
    "termination": "Terminate after a successful hold duration is completed or after retries are exhausted."
