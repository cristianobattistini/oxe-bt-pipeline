  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator above a white table must locate and pick up a small yellow container among several distractors (green bottle, orange container, cans, and a red block). The contact sheet shows approach from above, alignment near the object, closure, and a short lift. The behavior prioritizes perception first, then cautious vertical approach, stable grasp with moderate force, and a brief lift to confirm acquisition while avoiding collisions with neighboring items.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is homed above the workspace", "Table area is reachable", "Gripper operational and empty", "Yellow object is on the table and visible or discoverable by scanning"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Open the gripper", "Detect or scan for the yellow object", "Move to a pregrasp height above the target", "Approach and align precisely over the target", "Close the gripper to grasp", "Verify grasp stability", "Lift the object slightly and hold briefly"],
    "success_criteria": ["Yellow object is in the gripper", "Lifted at least 0.10 m from table", "No collisions with other objects", "Grasp stability confirmed"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, perform a spiral scan", "If alignment fails, re-approach above target", "If grasp is unstable, reopen and retry from pregrasp", "If lift meets resistance, retreat slightly and re-align"],
    "termination": "Terminate after a stable grasp has been lifted and held for the specified duration."
