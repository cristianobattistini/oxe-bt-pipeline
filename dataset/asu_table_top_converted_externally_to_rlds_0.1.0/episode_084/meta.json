  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates over a cluttered white tabletop with multiple small containers and bottles. The goal is to locate the green glass bottle seen across frames, grasp it securely from the side, lift it, move above a clear spot on the table, and place it down in a controlled, low-impact manner. The behavior includes perception, grasp synthesis, guarded vertical approach, and release, followed by a short retreat to avoid collisions with nearby items.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is reachable and collision-free around the bottle", "Camera provides visibility of the green glass bottle", "Gripper calibrated and able to open to 0.06 m", "Table surface can be contacted safely at low force"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Open gripper and detect the green bottle", "Move above and compute a side grasp pose", "Execute grasp and verify stability", "Lift and translate above the placement area", "Lower until contact and place down the bottle", "Release and retreat a short distance"],
    "success_criteria": ["Bottle ends upright or stably resting on the tabletop", "No collision with other objects during motion", "Grasp remains stable until release", "End-effector retreats clear after placing"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception failure or occlusion: retry object detection", "Grasp slip: recompute grasp and retry", "Early table contact: stop descent at force threshold and adjust pose", "Crowding near goal: choose a slightly offset placement region"],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful placement, release, and retreat, or after retries are exhausted."
