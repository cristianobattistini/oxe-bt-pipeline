  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed UR-style manipulator must push the Coca-Cola bottle on a white tabletop among several other objects (green bottle, blue can/bottle, colored cups/blocks). The robot first ensures the target is perceived, then approaches and aligns its tool to a neutral yaw. Without grasping, it performs a lateral push motion on the bottle for a short distance, after which it retreats and pauses. The scene is cluttered but static; pushing should avoid tipping or colliding with nearby items.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear of unexpected obstacles around push path",
      "Coca-Cola bottle is standing and visible",

      "Execute a lateral push on the bottle.",
      "Retreat and briefly wait to stabilize."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Bottle is displaced along intended lateral direction by ~0.15 m",
      "No toppling of the target or collisions with other objects",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails, scan in a spiral pattern and retry.",
      "If alignment drifts, re-run ApproachAndAlign and reset yaw.",
      "If push stalls due to friction, attempt a second push with adjusted approach (not encoded here)."
