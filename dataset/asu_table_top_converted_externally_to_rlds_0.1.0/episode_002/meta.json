  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator operates over a small round table holding multiple small objects (cans, bottles, a red block). The task is to put down a small white carton that is presumed to already be grasped. The robot should align above a clear table area, descend until contact to avoid dropping, release the gripper, and back off to a safe height. Precision matters due to nearby objects and limited free space.",
    "preconditions": ["White carton is already in the gripper", "Clear table area is available", "Arm is operational and within workspace"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Verify the white carton is currently held", "Approach and align above the table area", "Move to a short hover above the table", "Lower slowly until contact is detected", "Open gripper to release the carton", "Retreat to a safe distance"],
    "success_criteria": ["Carton lies stably on the table", "No collision with neighboring items", "Gripper fully releases the carton", "Arm retreats to safe clearance"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If object not detected in gripper, abort and request human or upstream pick", "If contact not detected within depth limit, retry approach or choose a different spot", "If release fails, open gripper again and nudge by tiny retreat/advance"],
    "termination": "Terminate after release and retreat complete with no collisions observed."
