  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator must open a small pot by lifting its metal lid. The scene shows a pot on a box-like stand on a tabletop and a robot arm with a parallel gripper. The robot first perceives the pot and lid, moves to a pregrasp pose above the lid, computes a pinch grasp around the knob/edge, and aligns precisely. After closing the gripper and confirming a stable grasp, it lifts the lid upward to clear the pot and retreats slightly to avoid collisions. Timing uses conservative bins; alignment requires tight tolerance.",
    "preconditions": ["Pot and lid are present and visible", "Robot has free workspace above the pot", "Gripper functional and empty", "Camera view provides sufficient features for detection"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect pot and lid", "Move above lid to a safe offset", "Compute grasp pose for lid (pinch)", "Open gripper and align", "Close gripper and pick", "Verify grasp stability", "Lift vertically", "Retreat slightly", "Wait briefly and terminate"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid is grasped securely", "Lid is lifted clear of the pot without collisions", "Robot retreats to a safe pose while holding the lid"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception fails → rescan and adjust viewpoint", "Grasp slip → reopen, recompute pose, retry pick", "Collision risk detected → increase offset_z or retreat before retry"],
    "termination": "Terminate when lid is off the pot and the robot has retreated to a safe distance."
