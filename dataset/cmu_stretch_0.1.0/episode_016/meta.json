  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator must open a green garbage can’s hinged lid. The scene shows a bin next to a table and the robot’s gripper approaching the lid area. The behavior emphasizes perception to localize the lid, careful alignment near the hinge, a light grasp on the lid edge, an open action using the bin-lid primitive, verification that the container is open, and a short retreat to clear the workspace.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot in front of the bin", "Bin lid reachable by the arm", "Camera provides visibility of the lid area", "Gripper operational"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Open gripper", "Perceive/confirm lid visibility", "Move above the lid", "Approach and align to the lid edge/handle", "Set yaw for hinge-friendly lift", "Close gripper on lid edge", "Execute container open (bin_lid)", "Verify lid is open", "Retreat a short distance"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid angle increases and stays open", "ContainerOpen condition reports true", "Robot ends in a safe, non-contact pose"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception fails → re-detect target", "Alignment poor → re-approach with tighter tolerance", "Slip during grasp → reopen/close gripper and retry", "Lid sticks → repeat open action with better yaw"],
    "termination": "Terminate once the container is reported open and the robot has retreated."
