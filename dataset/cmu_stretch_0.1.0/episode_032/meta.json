  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator must lift the metal lid off a small pot placed on a box atop a table. The contact sheet shows the arm moving in from the right, aligning above the lidâ€™s handle, descending to make contact, closing the gripper, and lifting the lid upward. The behavior tree prioritizes reliable perception, precise alignment, gentle grasping, and a vertical lift to avoid collisions with the pot rim or nearby objects.",

    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Verify or actively scan until the lid is visible.",
      "Move above the lid and open the gripper.",
      "Compute a top grasp on the lid handle and align precisely.",
      "Lower until contact and pick using the computed grasp.",
      "Verify grasp stability.",
      "Lift vertically and retreat from the pot area."

    "success_criteria": ["Lid is securely held by the gripper", "Lid is lifted clear of the pot without collision", "Robot retreats to a safe offset"],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If lid not visible: scan with an arc pattern and retry up to 3 times.",
      "If alignment fails: re-approach using the same computed grasp pose.",
      "If grasp slips: reopen, recompute grasp, and retry pick.",
      "If contact not detected: lower again within safe depth."

    "termination": "End when the lid is lifted above the pot and the robot has retreated to a safe distance."
