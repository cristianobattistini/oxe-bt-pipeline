  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The scene shows a mobile manipulator near a wooden cabinet with metal handles and a countertop holding a tissue box and a red cup. The robot arm approaches the cabinet front, aligns with a horizontal drawer handle, grasps it, and performs a pulling motion to open the drawer. The plan emphasizes reliable perception of the handle, correct endâ€‘effector yaw for a bar handle, and gentle force when closing the gripper. After opening, the arm retreats to avoid collisions and checks that the drawer is indeed open.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot has free access to the cabinet front",
