  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The robot must locate and lift open the lid of a green garbage can. The task involves scanning for the container, detecting the lid specifically, positioning above it, aligning the gripper properly, grasping the lid with a pulling motion, lifting it upward, and fully opening the container. The sequence requires precise manipulation and container handling capabilities.",
    "preconditions": ["robot is mobile and has manipulation capabilities", "green garbage can is present in environment", "lid is accessible and operable", "gripper is functional"],

    "success_criteria": ["garbage can lid is fully open", "robot has safely retreated", "no damage to container or robot"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["detection failure - retry scanning with different patterns", "grasp failure - recompute grasp pose with alternative strategy", "alignment issues - adjust tolerance and retry approach"],
