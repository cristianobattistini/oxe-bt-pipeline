  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The robot operates at a countertop-facing cabinet. The goal is to open a small right-side hinged door using its handle. The plan first perceives the handle, approaches the cabinet, prepares the gripper, computes a pull-style grasp, verifies the pose, aligns, grasps, actuates an open motion for the hinged door, then releases and retreats to a safe pose. Timeouts and small tolerances are used to keep motions reliable in a confined workspace near the table edge and other objects.",

      "Command an open operation on the hinged door.",
      "Release the handle and retreat to clear the door swing."

      "If detection fails, re-detect and re-approach the cabinet.",
      "If grasp is unstable, reopen gripper, realign, and recompute grasp pose.",
      "If door resists opening, retry open with a fresh alignment after a small retreat."
