  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A Stretch-like mobile manipulator operates in a kitchen scene with a wooden cabinet and drawers beneath a dark countertop. The robot must open a drawer by grasping its handle and pulling it outward. The contact-sheet shows progressive approach, alignment, contact, and an outward motion that increases drawer opening across frames. The plan prioritizes reliable perception and alignment, a firm yet moderate grasp, and a straight pull along the drawer’s opening axis, followed by a safe retreat and release.",
    "preconditions": ["Drawer is reachable by the end effector", "Handle (drawer_handle) is at least partly visible", "Workspace is free of obstructions around pull path", "Gripper operational with width ≥ 0.09 m"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect drawer_handle", "Open gripper", "Approach and align to handle with tight tolerance", "Visually verify handle pose", "Set end-effector yaw to 90° to match handle", "Close gripper with moderate force", "Pull along x axis by 0.2 m", "Check drawer is open", "Retreat 0.1 m away", "Release handle"],
    "success_criteria": ["Condition ContainerOpen(target='drawer') succeeds", "Drawer front translates outward visibly by several centimeters", "Gripper releases without collision"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails: re-detect or scan area", "If alignment fails: re-approach with same tolerance", "If grasp slips: reopen, realign, and regrasp with higher force (within limits)", "If pull obstructed: retreat slightly and retry pull"],
    "termination": "Terminate after ContainerOpen confirms success and the retreat + release steps complete."
