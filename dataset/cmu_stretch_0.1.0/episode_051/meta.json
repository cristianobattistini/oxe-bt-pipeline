  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator approaches a wooden cabinet with a bar-style drawer handle. The goal is to open the drawer visible in the frames by first localizing the handle, aligning the end-effector, grasping securely, then executing a pulling motion to slide the drawer open. The counter, tissue box, cup, and refrigerator are static context. The plan prioritizes precise alignment and moderate closing force, followed by a short retreat after verifying the drawer has opened.",

      "Robot is in front of the cabinet within reachable distance",
