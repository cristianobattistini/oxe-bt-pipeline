    "overview": "A mobile manipulator with a parallel gripper operates in a kitchen scene with a wooden cabinet and a drawer under a countertop. The robot must visually acquire the drawer handle, align its gripper, grasp the handle, and execute the opening action. Visual scanning is allowed if the handle is not immediately visible. Motions should be precise near the handle, using moderate gripping force. After the drawer opens, the robot retreats slightly to avoid collision with the drawer front.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear in front of the drawer",
      "Drawer is initially closed",

      "Drawer front translates outward from cabinet body",

      "Handle not detected -> scan with retries",
      "Misalignment -> repeat approach-and-align",
      "Slip during pull -> reopen, regrasp, and try again"

    "termination": "Terminate when drawer is confirmed opened and the robot has retreated to a safe distance."
