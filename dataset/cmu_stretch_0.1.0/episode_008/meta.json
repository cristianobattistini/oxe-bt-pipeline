  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator approaches a green garbage bin positioned beside a table. The objective is to lift and open the bin’s hinged lid using the end-effector. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception of the bin, precise alignment to the lid edge, and a safe opening motion, followed by verification and a retreat to avoid collisions. Timeouts and capped attempts bound the perception and opening actions to keep the routine robust under imperfect sensing.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot base is positioned within reachable workspace of the bin",
      "End-effector is free and operational",
      "Green bin with a hinged lid is present in view or discoverable by scan",

      "Execute the container opening routine for a bin lid.",
      "Confirm the lid state is open.",
      "Retreat to a standby pose."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "The lid is observed to be open (hinge angle increased and ContainerOpen condition satisfied).",
      "No collisions with the table, bin body, or environment.",
      "Robot ends in a safe, re-usable pose."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Bin not initially visible → perform ScanForTarget and retry detection.",
      "Alignment drifts → re-run ApproachAndAlign from MoveAbove waypoint.",
      "Lid resists opening → re-attempt OpenContainer after slight re-alignment.",
      "Timeouts → abort and retreat to avoid lingering contact."
