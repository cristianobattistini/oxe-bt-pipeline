  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator must open a green garbage bin with a hinged lid. The scene shows a bin beside a table; the robotâ€™s gripper approaches the small handle on the lid. The behavior includes perception to localize the bin and handle, careful approach with yaw alignment, pre-grasp opening of the gripper, grasp closure, and an opening motion abstracted by an OpenContainer action for a bin lid. The robot verifies the lid is open and then retreats to avoid collisions.",

    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception fails: rescan the area", "Misalignment: re-approach and realign yaw", "Slip during grasp: reopen, realign, and regrasp", "Lid jam: increase approach precision or adjust pull height slightly"],
    "termination": "Terminate after ContainerOpen is true and the robot has retreated."
