  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator (Stretch) is positioned in front of a kitchen cabinet under a countertop. The target is a mid-level drawer with a bar-style handle. The robot must perceive the handle, align its gripper, grasp it, execute the opening motion (modeled via an OpenContainer action for a drawer), retreat slightly to avoid collision with the front face and surroundings, and finally release the handle. The sequence emphasizes reliable perception, precise alignment, and a smooth opening motion consistent with the frames.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot has line of sight to the cabinet drawer handle",
      "Workspace around the drawer is unobstructed",
      "Gripper functional and free of objects",

      "Open gripper and detect the drawer handle.",

      "Close gripper to secure the handle.",
      "Open the drawer (container type: drawer).",
      "Retreat slightly and release the handle."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Drawer translates outward from the cabinet by a visible margin",
      "No collisions with cabinet or countertop",
      "Gripper releases cleanly after opening",
      "Robot ends in a safe, slightly retracted pose"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails, re-run perception and recompute grasp pose.",
      "If alignment fails, re-approach with tighter tolerance.",
      "If opening stalls, retreat a little and retry the opening motion."
    ],
    "termination": "When the drawer is open and the handle has been released with the robot safely retracted."
