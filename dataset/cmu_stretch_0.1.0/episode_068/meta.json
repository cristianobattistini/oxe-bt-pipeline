  "task_summary": "Detect the green trash bin, pre-open the gripper, approach and align to the lid edge, make contact, grasp, and lift the bin lid open; verify it is open and retreat safely.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator interacts with a green garbage bin positioned beside a table. The robot must open the hinged bin lid by grasping its front edge and lifting it. The sequence prioritizes reliable perception of the bin, careful approach with alignment, gentle contact, a low-force grasp, and a lifting action executed via an explicit container-opening primitive. The scene shows the arm approaching from the right with the bin and translucent liner visible. Safety requires verifying that the lid is open before retreating.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot arm powered and homed", "Workspace clear around the green bin", "Camera has unobstructed view of bin lid edge", "Gripper operational"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect green bin", "Open gripper", "Move above lid edge with small vertical offset", "Approach and align to lid edge within 1 cm tolerance", "Lower until contact is detected", "Close gripper with low force to secure edge", "Open the container (bin lid) by lifting", "Verify lid is open", "Retreat to a safe distance"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid rotates upward visibly", "Condition `ContainerOpen` returns success", "No collision with table or bin body", "Gripper releases without snagging liner"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception fails → re-detect or scan area", "Misalignment/slip → reopen gripper, realign, and retry approach", "Insufficient lift → reissue OpenContainer with slightly longer duration", "Unexpected contact → retreat then re-approach"],
    "termination": "Terminate when lid state is open and the arm has retreated to a safe pose."
