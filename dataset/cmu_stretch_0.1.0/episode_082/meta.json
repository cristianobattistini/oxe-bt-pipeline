  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The robot operates on a tabletop scene with a metal pot featuring a small top lid/knob. The arm must first localize the lid, approach from above with an open gripper, compute a top grasp, align precisely, make gentle contact, and close the gripper to secure the lid. After confirming a stable grasp, the robot lifts the lid vertically to clear the pot and retreats slightly to a safe pose. The sequence emphasizes reliable perception, vertical extraction to avoid collisions with the pot rim, and brief stabilization at the end.",
