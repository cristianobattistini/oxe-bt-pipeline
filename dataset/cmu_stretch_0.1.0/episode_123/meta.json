    "overview": "The sequence controls a Hello Robot Stretch‑like manipulator in a kitchen scene with a stainless appliance featuring a horizontal bar handle consistent with a dishwasher door; the robot must perceive the handle, approach precisely, grasp, and execute an opening motion appropriate for a downward‑hinged door, then back away to avoid collision while the door opens.[web:3][web:6]",
    "preconditions": ["Appliance is accessible from the right side with unobstructed handle reach.[web:3]", "Robot base is stably positioned and arm has clearance for pulling a hinged door.[web:6]", "Gripper operational and able to close on a bar‑style handle.[web:6]"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Check visibility of the dishwasher handle; if not visible, scan raster to find it.[web:3]", "Detect and localize the handle and compute a pulling grasp pose.[web:6]", "Approach and align, open gripper, then execute the pick to secure the handle.[web:6]", "Set wrist yaw for pulling direction and issue an open‑container command for a hinged door.[web:3]", "Retreat to create space once the door begins opening and wait briefly to settle.[web:6]"],
    "success_criteria": ["Dishwasher door angle increases from closed; latch disengaged and motion observed.[web:5]", "Robot maintains stable grasp during initial opening without collision.[web:6]"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If handle not found, repeat raster scan up to configured attempts.[web:3]", "If grasp unstable, re‑open gripper and recompute grasp before retrying pull.[web:6]"],
    "termination": "Tree terminates after a successful open operation followed by a short wait and retreat to a safe standoff.[web:3]"
