  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The robot must lift the lid off a small pot placed on a box on a tabletop. The sequence begins with perception to localize the pot lid, followed by a safe approach from above. A top grasp is computed for the lid’s knob, the gripper opens, aligns, and executes a pick. After confirming the object is in the gripper, the robot lifts along +Z to clear the pot and retreats to a safe distance. The scene includes a Stretch-like arm, the pot with lid, a tabletop, and surrounding objects; motion is primarily vertical to avoid collisions.",
