  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A stationary manipulator must lift the metal lid from a pot positioned on a small black stand on a benchtop. The robot first detects and verifies the lid, opens its gripper, and approaches from above. After aligning to the lid handle, it closes the gripper to grasp, performs an opening motion by lifting the lid upward, and retreats to clear the pot rim. Visual confirmation and stable grasp are important due to reflections and clutter around the workspace.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot base and arm within reachable workspace of the pot",
      "Camera view of pot lid not fully occluded",
      "Gripper operational and unobstructed",

      "Execute container-opening motion for a 'lid' by lifting upward.",
      "Retreat to clear the pot rim."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Lid is visibly above the pot rim with clearance",
      "No collision with pot, bench, or stand",
      "Grasp remains stable during lift"

      "If detection fails, re-detect or scan again before proceeding",
      "If grasp slips, reopen gripper, realign, and regrasp",
      "If collisions detected, retreat a short distance and re-approach with smaller tolerance"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate when the lid is lifted and the arm has retreated to a safe distance."
