  "task_summary": "Detect the green garbage can and lift its hinged lid using a pinch grasp on the lid edge, opening the bin and then retreating.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator with a parallel gripper must open a green garbage can with a hinged lid visible near a table. The robot approaches from the right, aligns to the lid edge, grasps the edge, lifts it upward to open, verifies the container is open, and retreats to a safe distance. The behavior includes perception fallback scanning, grasp pose computation, and a controlled vertical lift. Constraints include limited timeout bins and small tolerances for alignment.",
    "preconditions": ["Green garbage can and lid visible within arm reach", "Robot gripper initialized and free", "Workspace around lid unobstructed", "Camera provides sufficient view to detect the lid edge"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Scan and verify visibility of green_can", "Detect the can and move near it", "Move above and align to lid_edge with tight tolerance", "Open gripper and compute grasp pose for lid_edge", "Execute pick using computed grasp", "Lift along z to raise the lid", "Invoke container open primitive and confirm lid state", "Retreat to clear the workspace"],
    "success_criteria": ["ContainerOpen condition becomes true for green_can", "Robot retreats 0.1 m after opening", "No collisions with table or bin during motion"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If visibility fails, raster scan attempts up to 3 times", "If grasp pose missing, abort pick and re-run detection/compute", "If pick fails, the sequence halts before lift to prevent dragging", "If lid resists opening, timeouts prevent indefinite force application"],
    "termination": "Tree succeeds when ContainerOpen evaluates true and the robot has retreated."
