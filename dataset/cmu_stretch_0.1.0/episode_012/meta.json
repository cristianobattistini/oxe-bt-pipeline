  "task_summary": "Locate the cabinet door handle, grasp it, open the door, release, and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator with a parallel gripper operates in a kitchen scene. The camera shows a countertop with a tissue box, a cabinet with drawers and a right-hand hinged door near a refrigerator. The robot must visually locate the door handle, approach and align precisely, grasp the handle, actuate the opening of the hinged door, then release and back away to a safe standoff. Timeouts, small approach tolerance, and moderate gripping force are used to balance reliability and speed.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot base positioned with reachable workspace to door handle", "Perception running and camera unobstructed", "Cabinet door not locked", "No humans or obstacles in immediate arm path"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Scan and detect the door handle", "Move to the handle and align the gripper", "Open gripper, then close on the handle", "Command container opening for a hinged door", "Release handle and retreat"],
    "success_criteria": ["Door opened beyond initial closed position by a visible margin", "No collision with cabinet, fridge, or countertop", "Gripper releases handle and robot retreats to safe distance"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Handle not detected → rescan", "Misalignment → re-approach and realign", "Grip slip → reopen and regrasp with same force", "Door jams → retry container open once before abort"],
    "termination": "Terminate when door is opened and the robot has released the handle and retreated."
