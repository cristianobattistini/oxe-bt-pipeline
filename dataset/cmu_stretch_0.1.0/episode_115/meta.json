  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The robot aligns to a cabinet drawer visible across the frames, localizes the horizontal bar handle, plans a side grasp, and latches on. After securing the grasp, it uses a container-opening primitive suited for drawers to pull the drawer outward, then retreats slightly to avoid collision with the panel. Timing and tolerances are conservative to ensure stable contact in a confined kitchen-like scene with a counter, tissue box, and cup.",
    "preconditions": ["Drawer and handle visible within camera view", "Arm workspace reachable to the handle", "No obstruction between end-effector and handle", "Gripper operational and free"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Open gripper and search/confirm handle presence", "Move above and align yaw to handle orientation", "Compute grasp and align precisely to contact", "Close gripper and confirm stable grasp", "Invoke drawer opening routine", "Retreat to a safe standoff and pause"],
    "success_criteria": ["Handle detected and grasp stable", "Drawer translated outward visibly", "No collisions with cabinet or countertop", "Robot ends in a safe standoff"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Handle not detected → raster scan and retry up to 3 times", "Misalignment → recompute grasp and realign", "Grasp slips → reopen, re-approach, and regrasp", "Drawer jam → increase attempts or abort with safe retreat"],
    "termination": "Terminate after drawer open action succeeds and retreat completes."
