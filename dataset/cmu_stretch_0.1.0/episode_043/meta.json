  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator must open a pot by lifting its metal lid. The scene shows a pot with a lid on a box-like base placed on a table. The robot should visually locate the lid, prepare the gripper, compute a top grasp on the knob/handle, align, grasp, and then lift vertically to clear the pot. Safety and contact stability are important to avoid sliding the lid or colliding with the pot rim. The task ends once the lid is clearly lifted off and the robot retreats slightly.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is powered and homed", "Workspace is clear around the pot", "Pot and lid are within reachable workspace", "Camera provides view of the lid", "Gripper is operational"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect the pot lid", "Open gripper to a suitable width", "Compute a top grasp pose on the lid", "Approach and align to the grasp pose with tight tolerance", "Execute grasp (Pick)", "Verify grasp stability", "Lift vertically by 0.1 m", "Retreat slightly from the pot", "Wait briefly to stabilize"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid is in the gripper", "Vertical clearance achieved (>=0.1 m)", "No visible collision with pot rim", "Grasp remains stable after lift"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, re-run detection or adjust view", "If alignment times out, retry approach", "If grasp is unstable, reopen and recompute grasp", "If lift meets resistance, lower and retry alignment"],
    "termination": "Terminate when lid is grasped and lifted by the target distance with stable hold, followed by a short retreat and wait."
