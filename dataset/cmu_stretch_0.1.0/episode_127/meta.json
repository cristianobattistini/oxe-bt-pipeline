  "task_summary": "Grasp the visible drawer handle and actuate an opening motion until the drawer is open, then retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The robot approaches a cabinet and opens a lower drawer by grasping its U-shaped handle and pulling the drawer outward. The contact-sheet shows progressive approach, grasp, and drawer displacement, culminating in a partially open drawer. The plan first ensures perception of the handle, orients the wrist, establishes a stable grasp, then uses a high-level open action for a drawer container. The sequence verifies the container state before retreating to clear the workspace, matching the observed frames.",
    "preconditions": ["Drawer handle is visible or discoverable with scanning", "Robot has clearance in front of the cabinet", "Gripper is functional and can close on a bar handle", "Controller supports container-opening primitives"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Navigate or move near cabinet area", "Detect the drawer handle", "Open gripper and align to the handle", "Set wrist yaw for bar-like grasp", "Close gripper to secure the handle", "Invoke drawer opening motion", "Confirm drawer is open", "Retreat slightly to avoid collision"],
    "success_criteria": ["Drawer reported open by state check", "Handle grasp achieved without slip", "Drawer visibly displaced outward", "Robot retreats to a safe standoff"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Handle not detected: retry detection up to three attempts", "Misalignment: re-approach and realign then retry grasp", "Grip slip during pull: reopen gripper, realign, and regrasp", "Drawer jams: pause and retry open sequence with a small retreat and re-approach"],
    "termination": "Terminate after container open is confirmed and the end-effector retreats to a safe standoff."
