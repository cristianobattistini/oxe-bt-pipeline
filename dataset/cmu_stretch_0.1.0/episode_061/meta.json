  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A Stretch-like mobile manipulator must open a wooden cabinet drawer visible beneath a dark countertop. The contact sheet shows the gripper approaching a horizontal bar handle on the drawer front, aligning beside the cabinet, and pulling the drawer open. The behavior first perceives and locates the handle, orients the tool to 90° yaw to match the bar, approaches with tight tolerance, grasps, and executes a container-open action specific to drawers. After the drawer is opened, the robot retreats slightly to avoid collision and releases the handle.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Cabinet drawer and handle are within reachable workspace",
      "No obstacles blocking approach along drawer pull direction",
      "Robot base is stable; arm has free range of motion",
      "Perception returns a detectable handle feature"
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Raster scan and detect the drawer handle.",
      "Move to a pregrasp pose and set end-effector yaw to 90°.",
      "Approach and align to the handle with tight tolerance; open gripper.",
      "Compute grasp pose with a pull strategy and verify key availability.",
      "Pick the handle and call the drawer open action.",
      "Retreat slightly, then open gripper to release."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Drawer front translates outward creating a visible opening gap",
      "Handle grasp remained stable during pull",
      "No collisions with cabinet, fridge, or countertop",
      "Robot retreats and releases the handle safely"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Handle not detected: repeat scan or adjust view",
      "Misalignment: re-orient TCP to 90° and re-approach",
      "Slip during pull: re-open, regrasp with new grasp pose",
      "Drawer jam: attempt smaller pull distance or re-approach"
    ],
    "termination": "End when the drawer is reported open and the robot has retreated and released the handle."
