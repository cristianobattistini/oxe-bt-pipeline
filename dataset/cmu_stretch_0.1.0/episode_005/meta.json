  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator with a parallel gripper approaches a green garbage bin with a hinged lid and plastic liner. The objective is to lift/open the lid. The behavior first perceives the bin and lid, positions above the lid, orients the wrist to a side approach, and refines alignment. The gripper is pre-opened to avoid collisions, then an OpenContainer primitive for a bin lid is executed. A brief wait allows the lid to settle before the system confirms the lid state and retreats to a safe distance. The scene includes a table and wall near the bin, imposing clearance constraints.",

      "Robot has free workspace in front of the bin",
