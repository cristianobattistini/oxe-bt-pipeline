  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator interacts with a small pot placed on a cube on a tabletop. The goal is to lift the lid off the pot. The robot must first ensure the lid is visible, localize it, compute a top-down grasp, and align above it. It opens the gripper, descends until contact, closes with low force on the lidâ€™s knob or handle, verifies grasp stability, lifts vertically to clear the pot, briefly stabilize, and retreat to a safe distance. Timing and forces are kept conservative to avoid knocking the pot.",

      "Open the gripper and descend slowly until contact.",
      "Close gripper with low force and verify grasp stability.",
      "Lift straight up, pause briefly, then retreat."

      "Lid is lifted clear of the pot rim",

      "Lid not detected: rescan using arc pattern up to 3 attempts",
      "Slipped grasp: reopen, re-approach, increase force by one bin if safe",
      "Unexpected contact: stop descent, retreat small distance, retry approach"
    ],
    "termination": "End when the lid is held in the gripper above the pot and the arm has retreated to a safe standoff."
