  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator (Stretch) is positioned at a workbench with a metal pot placed on a small box. The goal is to lift the pot’s lid by targeting the lid handle. The robot first perceives the lid, moves to a safe height above the pot, computes a top grasp on the handle, aligns and lowers until contact, then closes the gripper and lifts the lid upward to clear the pot. Constraints include tight alignment and low-force contact during approach to avoid sliding the lid.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is in reach of the pot", "Workspace is free of obstructions around the lid", "Gripper is functional and can open to 0.09 m", "Camera can detect the lid/handle"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect lid", "Move above pot", "Open gripper", "Compute top grasp on lid handle", "Verify grasp pose available", "Yaw to 90° for approach", "Align to handle and descend until contact", "Close gripper to secure handle", "Lift/retreat vertically", "Confirm lid is in gripper"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid is grasped by the handle", "Lid is lifted clear of the pot rim", "No collision with pot or environment"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception miss → retry detection up to 3 times", "Misalignment → reattempt ApproachAndAlign", "Weak grasp → reopen, recompute grasp, and retry", "Unexpected contact force → stop descent and retreat slightly"],
    "termination": "End when the lid is detected in the gripper and the arm has retreated to a clear height."
