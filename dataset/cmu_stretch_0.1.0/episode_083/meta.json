  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator interacts with a green garbage can positioned beside a table. The goal is to lift open the can’s hinged lid. The robot must first localize the bin and lid, approach from above, align precisely, pinch-grasp the lid lip, lift along +Z to open the bin lid, verify the opening state, and back away. Timing uses moderate timeouts; grasp uses a pinch strategy. The scene shows the bin, lid, table, and the robot’s gripper approaching the lid edge.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot is in front of the bin with reachable workspace", "Gripper operational and initially open", "Lid has a graspable lip", "Environment free of unexpected obstacles"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Open gripper", "Perceive/confirm green bin location", "Move above the lid with small vertical offset", "Approach and align with tight tolerance", "Compute pinch grasp on lid edge and pick", "Lift along +Z to open the lid", "Mark container as open", "Verify open state", "Retreat a safe distance"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid angle increases and remains open", "No collision with table/bin rim", "Robot retreats with lid released or not under load", "ContainerOpen condition reports success"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception fails → scan pattern again (fallback already handles)", "Missed grasp → recompute grasp and retry pick", "Insufficient lift → perform another small +Z MoveDelta", "Unexpected contact → retreat then re-approach"],
    "termination": "Terminate when ContainerOpen is true and the robot has retreated the specified distance."
