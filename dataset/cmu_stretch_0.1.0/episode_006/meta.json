  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator with a parallel gripper interacts with a wooden cabinet. The goal is to open a closed drawer. The robot must first visually locate the drawer handle, move to a safe pre-grasp pose, align, grasp the handle, and pull to open. The sequence emphasizes reliable perception, tight alignment (±1 cm), and a modest gripper force to avoid slipping. After opening, the robot retreats to clear the drawer front while maintaining scene safety around the countertop and adjacent appliances.",
    "preconditions": ["Drawer is initially closed", "Handle is visible or discoverable from the starting view", "Workspace is free of obstacles along pull direction", "Gripper is operational"],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Detect the drawer handle.",
      "If the drawer is already open, skip opening; otherwise continue.",
      "Open gripper and move to a pre-grasp pose.",
      "Align precisely to the handle and close gripper.",
      "Execute the open action on the drawer.",
      "Retreat to clear the drawer front."
    ],
    "success_criteria": ["Drawer front translates outward noticeably", "No collisions with cabinet or countertop", "Gripper releases or maintains safe hold after motion", "End pose is clear of the drawer face"],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Handle not detected → re-perceive or adjust viewpoint.",
      "Misalignment → retry alignment and approach.",
      "Slip during pull → increase force within limits and reattempt.",
      "Mechanical stop reached early → stop and report."
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate when the drawer is confirmed open or after configured retries/timeouts."
