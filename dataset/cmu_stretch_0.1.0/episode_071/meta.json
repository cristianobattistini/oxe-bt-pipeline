  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator operates in a kitchen scene with a stainless steel dishwasher below a small oven, a fridge on the left, and wooden cabinets on the right. The robot must locate the dishwasher handle, approach with proper yaw alignment, compute a pulling grasp on the bar handle, close the gripper, and execute an opening action consistent with a downward-hinged door. After actuating the door, the robot briefly waits, checks that the dishwasher is open, and retreats to clear the workspace.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Dishwasher present with accessible bar handle",
      "Path to the handle is collision-free",

      "Open the dishwasher as a hinged door.",
      "Wait briefly and verify the door state.",
      "Retreat to a safe distance."

      "Dishwasher door angle increases from closed state",

      "If grasp slips: re-align yaw and recompute grasp",
      "If door resists: repeat open action with improved approach"
