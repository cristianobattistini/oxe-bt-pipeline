  "task_summary": "Detect the pot lid, grasp its handle with a pinch strategy, lift the lid vertically, and retreat while holding it clear of the pot.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator with a parallel gripper must remove a small round lid from a metal pot placed on a tabletop. The robot observes the scene, aligns to the lidâ€™s handle, and performs a precise pinch grasp. After establishing contact and grasp, it lifts the lid vertically to clear the pot, then retreats slightly to a safe position. The sequence emphasizes reliable perception, careful alignment, gentle approach until contact, and a clean vertical lift to avoid scraping the pot rim.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot and camera have line-of-sight to the pot lid", "Workspace is clear around the pot", "Gripper operational and open at start", "Kinematics allow approach from the side/top"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect the lid and verify visibility", "Move above the pot to a pregrasp height and set yaw", "Compute a pinch grasp for the lid handle", "Align, descend until contact, and execute the grasp", "Lift vertically to clear the pot", "Retreat to a safe offset"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid is securely grasped", "Lid is lifted vertically clear of the pot rim without collision", "Robot retreats to a safe pose while holding the lid"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, re-scan and adjust view", "If alignment fails, recompute grasp and re-approach", "If grasp slips, reopen, re-align, and retry with the same grasp key"],
    "termination": "Tree ends after retreat once the lid is elevated and clear of the pot."
