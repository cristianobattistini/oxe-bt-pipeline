  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator interacts with a small pot placed on a box on a tabletop. The goal is to lift the potâ€™s lid vertically and pull back safely. The robot first perceives the pot and lid, then moves to a pregrasp above the pot. With the gripper opened, it computes a top grasp for the lid, aligns precisely, grasps, lifts along the z-axis, and retreats to clear the workspace. Timing and tolerances are conservative to avoid collisions with the pot rim and nearby fixtures.",
