  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator with a parallel gripper operates at a countertop. A small pot with a metallic lid sits on a box-like stand. The robot must detect the lid, approach from above with an open gripper, compute a top grasp around the knob/handle, secure the grasp, lift the lid upward to clear the pot, and retreat slightly. Visual evidence across frames shows approach, contact, lift, and the lid removed above the pot.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot at safe reach of the pot", "Workspace free of obstacles above the lid", "Gripper calibrated and operational", "Camera view includes pot and lid"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Verify lid visibility or actively scan for it", "Move above the lid and open the gripper", "Compute a top grasp pose and confirm availability", "Align and execute the grasp", "Verify grasp stability", "Lift the lid vertically", "Retreat to clear the pot"],
    "success_criteria": ["Lid detached from the pot", "Pot opening unobstructed", "Object in gripper after lift", "No collisions with surroundings"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception failure → rescan until visible", "Grasp misalignment → recompute grasp and reattempt", "Slippage → reopen, realign, and pick again", "Collision risk → retreat and re-approach from above"],
    "termination": "End when the container is open and the lid is lifted and clear of the pot."
