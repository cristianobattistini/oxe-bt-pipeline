  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A mobile manipulator approaches a kitchen dishwasher. The goal is to pull open the dishwasher door by grasping its bar handle. The robot must first perceive the handle, align its end-effector, and grasp with a pull-oriented strategy. After establishing a stable grasp, it actuates an opening by pulling the hinged door downward/outward until clearly open, then releases and retreats. Constraints include precise alignment on a reflective stainless surface and avoiding collisions with nearby appliances and cabinetry.",
    "preconditions": ["Dishwasher is reachable", "Handle is unobstructed and visible", "Gripper operational and empty", "Sufficient clearance in front of the door"],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Perceive and localize the dishwasher handle.",
      "Open gripper and compute a pull-oriented grasp.",
      "Approach and align to the handle; set yaw to match bar orientation.",
      "Execute grasp (pick) on the handle.",
      "Trigger container opening for the hinged dishwasher door (pull action).",
      "Retreat, release the handle, and back off to a safe distance."
    ],
    "success_criteria": ["Door angle increases and remains open", "No object slippage during pull", "Robot retreats without collision", "Handle released successfully"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Handle not detected → perform another perception pass or small viewpoint change", "Misalignment → re-approach and realign then retry grasp", "Grasp slip → reopen gripper, recompute grasp, retry", "Door stuck → increase pull duration (longer timeout) and retry"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the dishwasher door is open and the robot has released the handle and retreated to a safe standoff."
