    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a T-shaped block and a robot arm with a circular tool tip. The goal is to push the T-block from its initial pose to a fixed goal location on the board. The behavior first ensures both the block and target are detected, then aligns the tool with the blockâ€™s pushing face, sets a stable yaw, performs a straight push for a fixed distance, and finally retreats and waits to settle. The control/observation cadence is nominally 10 Hz.",
