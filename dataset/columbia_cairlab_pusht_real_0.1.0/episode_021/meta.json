  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block on a planar workspace until it reaches a marked target zone. The behavior prioritizes visual confirmation of both the block and goal, a short vertical clearance approach, fine in-plane alignment, yaw setting, and a single straight push. The control/observation cadence is modest (10 Hz), so actions use conservative timeouts and a simple, robust sequence. After the push, the robot retreats and pauses to avoid disturbing the final placement.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace clear and planar",
      "T-shaped block present within camera view",

      "Execute a straight push toward the target.",
      "Retreat and briefly wait for settling."

    "success_criteria": [
      "Block’s centroid overlaps the target zone outline",

      "If object is not visible, perform scanning again.",
      "If alignment fails, re-run ApproachAndAlign and yaw verification.",
      "If push stalls or slips, re-approach and reattempt with the same path."
