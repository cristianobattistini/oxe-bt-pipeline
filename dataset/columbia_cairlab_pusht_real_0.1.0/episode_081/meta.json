  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm with a circular blue end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a white tabletop toward a fixed target region while operating with 10 Hz perception and control cycles. The plan uses robust perception retries to localize both the block and the goal, aligns approach with a tight tolerance, establishes light contact, and executes repeated pushes to advance and slightly rotate the block as seen in the frames. After sufficient motion, the system checks goal proximity and backs away to leave the scene safe.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot and camera calibrated to workspace", "Table clear except for the T block and goal marker", "End-effector free of obstacles", "Controller running at nominal 10 Hz"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Scan to detect the T block", "Scan to detect the fixed goal region", "Approach and align to the block with tight tolerance", "Set yaw for a side push and move above pre-contact height", "Lower until gentle contact is detected", "Repeat short pushes toward the goal to translate/rotate the block", "Retreat to a safe standoff and verify at-goal condition"],
    "success_criteria": ["T block’s pose lies within the goal region bounds", "No excessive end-effector force during contact", "Robot safely retreats after goal is reached"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Block or goal not detected → rescan with retries", "Contact not achieved → re-approach and lower again", "Push under/overshoot → repeat additional push cycles or re-align"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the block is within the goal region and the robot has retreated to a safe distance."
