  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar workspace until it sits inside a T-shaped target outline. The sequence begins with perception to locate the block, followed by a safe overhead approach and fine alignment. The robot executes several incremental pushes along a consistent direction to translate and orient the block toward the target. A brief verification and final nudge complete the placement. Timeouts are moderate to accommodate real motion; the task assumes planar contact and no grasping.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear and planar", "T-block present and visible to the camera", "Target outline is static and known", "End-effector is free (no object grasped)"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect or scan for the T-block", "Move above and align to the block", "Set desired push direction toward the target", "Perform three incremental pushes", "Verify target outline and re-align", "Deliver a short final push to seat the block", "Check goal region reached", "Retreat and pause"],
    "success_criteria": ["Block’s footprint lies within the T-shaped outline", "No further contact force needed to maintain pose", "End-effector is safely retracted"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, scan with retries", "If alignment drifts, re-approach before pushing", "If block stalls, repeat short pushes", "Abort if IsAt(goal_region) never becomes true within allotted attempts"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the goal region is reached and the robot has retreated."
