  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar whiteboard surface until it aligns with a fixed T-shaped target mark. The sequence begins with visual detection of both the block and the target, followed by a guarded approach to the block with tight in-plane alignment. The tool yaw is set for consistent pushing. The robot executes several short pushes, re-aligning between pushes, then verifies proximity to the target shape before retreating. Frequencies are 10 Hz for observation and control.",
