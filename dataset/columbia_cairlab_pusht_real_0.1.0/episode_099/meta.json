  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm with a cylindrical end-effector interacts on a white tabletop. The scene contains a red T-shaped block and a small circular mark on the workspace indicating the goal region. The robot must perceive the block and the goal, approach above the block, refine alignment, then apply one or more planar pushes to move the T toward the goal. Motions run at ~10 Hz perception/control; careful alignment helps maintain contact during the push.",

    "success_criteria": ["Block translated toward/into the goal region", "No loss of contact during push segments", "Robot safely retreats after task"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception miss → fall back to DetectObject", "Minor underpush → repeat push cycle", "Misalignment → re-ticking the sequence re-runs ApproachAndAlign"],
