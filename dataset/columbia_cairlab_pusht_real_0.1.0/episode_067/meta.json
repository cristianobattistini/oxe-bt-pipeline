  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-type manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block into a marked target outline on a tabletop. The sequence begins with perception of the block and the goal area, followed by an approach from above and in-plane alignment. The tool yaw is set to match the push direction along the table. The robot performs two short pushes to translate and settle the block into the target outline, checks that the block is at the goal, and finally retreats to clear the workspace. Timing is modest with sub-second action timeouts.",
