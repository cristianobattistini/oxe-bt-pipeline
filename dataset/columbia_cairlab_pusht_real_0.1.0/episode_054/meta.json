  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A stationary manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar surface to a designated goal region. The contact sheet shows the robot approaching from above/right, making contact, and pushing the block down-left toward a drawn target/outline. The behavior uses robust perception (detect or scan), precise alignment before contact, a set orientation for the tool, and one or more push strokes, finishing with a short retreat. Control and observation are assumed discrete at 10 Hz.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace clear and flat", "T-shaped block present on table", "Goal mark visible on surface", "End-effector free (gripper opened)"],

      "Open gripper to avoid collision.",
      "Detect the block; if not visible, scan to localize it.",
      "Move above and align precisely to the block’s push face.",
      "Confirm visibility, set yaw to push direction.",
      "Execute a long push stroke toward the goal, then a shorter corrective stroke.",
      "Retreat slightly and wait briefly."

    "success_criteria": ["Block center overlaps goal region/outline", "No loss of contact during push strokes", "Robot retreats to a safe clearance pose"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception failure → scan spiral and retry", "Misalignment → re-approach and align", "Insufficient displacement → execute additional push stroke(s)"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the planned push strokes complete and the robot has retreated."
