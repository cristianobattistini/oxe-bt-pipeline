  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A stationary manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block until it fits the drawn T target on the table. The robot first perceives both the block and the target, then approaches from a suitable yaw to contact the block’s stem/crossbar. It executes sequential pushes: a longer straight push to translate the piece and a shorter angled push to finish alignment. Finally, it verifies placement and retreats. The sequence runs at 10 Hz observation/control, so actions use moderate timeouts and small tolerances for alignment.",
