  "task_summary": "Perceive the T-shaped block and goal, align the circular end-effector, make gentle contact, then push the block along the table toward the goal region and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR5-style manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a tabletop into a marked goal region. The contact-sheet shows the arm approaching from above, establishing contact near the block’s stem, and executing a planar push while maintaining alignment. The design emphasizes reliable perception, controlled contact establishment, and a straight-line push. Observation and control occur at 10 Hz, but timing bins rely on library-discrete timeouts. Recovery includes re-scanning if the block is not visible and re-approach if contact is lost.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear except for the T-shaped block and a goal outline", "Camera feed available for object visibility", "Robot reachable workspace covers block and goal", "End-effector pose control enabled in the plane"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Check visibility or scan for the T-shaped block", "Move above the block with safe clearance", "Yaw-align the tool with intended push direction", "Lower until contact and verify contact", "Align toward goal and execute a straight push", "Retreat to a safe distance"],
    "success_criteria": ["Block’s centroid intersects the goal region", "No collisions with table fixtures", "Stable contact during the push"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If block not detected, raster scan up to 3 attempts", "If contact not detected, re-approach and lower again", "If push deviates, re-align and perform another push segment"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the block is pushed into the goal region and the robot has retreated to a safe standoff."
