    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block to a drawn goal mark on a tabletop. The contact sheet shows approach, contact, and a progressive push that aligns the block with the target outline. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, gentle contact establishment, and a straight push along the table plane. The scene includes a single T-shaped block, a goal outline on the table, and the robot tool.",
