  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop pushing task: a UR-style arm with a cylindrical end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a white surface into a marked goal zone. The BT first ensures both the T block and the goal are visually located. The robot then moves above the block, aligns its tool to the intended push direction, and executes a single straight push toward the goal. A short wait stabilizes motion before the robot retreats. The scene shows the T starting left of the goal and ending near/inside the outlined zone. No grasping is used; only contact pushing.",
