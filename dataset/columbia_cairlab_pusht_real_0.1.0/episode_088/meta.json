  "task_summary": "Perceive the T-shaped block and the circular goal, approach and make gentle contact, align yaw, then execute one long and one fine push to place the block inside the goal circle before retreating.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar workspace into a marked circular goal region. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, gentle contact establishment, yaw alignment of the tool, and staged pushing to control rotation of the T-piece. Visual evidence shows a red T block, a drawn circle goal on the tabletop, and a cylindrical tool approaching from above. The plan uses fallback perception, precise alignment, a primary push to traverse most of the distance, a secondary corrective push for fine placement, and a safe retreat once the goal is achieved.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear except for the T block and goal mark", "Camera view of the table is unobstructed", "Robot is homed and above the workspace", "Control and observation run near 10 Hz"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect or scan for the T block and the goal", "Move above the block and align laterally with tight tolerance", "Lower until first contact is detected at low speed and force threshold", "Set yaw to align push direction", "Execute a long push toward the goal", "Re-align to the goal if needed and perform a short corrective push", "Retreat and wait briefly to stabilize"],
    "success_criteria": ["Block’s footprint overlaps the goal circle within a small tolerance", "Block remains stationary after final push for a short dwell", "Tool is clear of the object and goal area"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If perception fails, rescan with raster/spiral patterns", "If contact is missed, re-approach and lower again", "If object rotates or overshoots, re-align yaw and apply a shorter corrective push", "If occluded, retreat slightly and retry perception"],
    "termination": "End when the block is inside the goal circle and the tool has retreated, or when retries/timeouts are exhausted."
