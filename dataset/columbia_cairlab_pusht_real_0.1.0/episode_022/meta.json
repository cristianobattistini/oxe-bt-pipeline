  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a red T-shaped block across a planar workspace until it reaches a marked target outline on the board. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception of both block and target, safe approach with alignment, and straight-line pushing with a set yaw to keep contact along the stem of the T. The sequence includes retries for perception, repeated short pushes to control motion, a final alignment near the goal, and a retreat to leave the scene clear.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear except for the T-shaped block and the target outline",

      "Re-align near the target outline and verify placement",
