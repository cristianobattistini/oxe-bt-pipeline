    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a robot arm with a cylindrical pusher interacting with a red T-shaped block and a blue outline indicating the desired final pose. The behavior requires detecting both the block and the target outline, approaching to a safe height, aligning yaw for lateral contact, then performing one or more pushes toward the outline. Success is assessed visually by the block’s pose overlapping the outline, after which the tool retreats to clear the workspace. Control and observation appear discrete and consistent with short action timeouts. [attached_file:1]",
