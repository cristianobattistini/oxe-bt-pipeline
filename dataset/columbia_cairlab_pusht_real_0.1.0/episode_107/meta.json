  "task_summary": "Detect the T-shaped block and the goal outline, approach with the circular end-effector, align and execute a few short pushes toward the goal, lightly press to settle, verify goal attainment, then retreat. Control/observation at 10 Hz.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style robot with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar workspace until it overlaps a fixed, T-shaped goal outline. The sequence begins with perception of the block and goal, followed by a safe approach above the block, orientation alignment of the tool, and multiple short pushes along a diagonal path observed in the frames. After reaching the outline, the robot performs a brief placement press for settling, verifies final position, and retreats to a safe height. Timing is modest, consistent with 10 Hz sensing and control.",
