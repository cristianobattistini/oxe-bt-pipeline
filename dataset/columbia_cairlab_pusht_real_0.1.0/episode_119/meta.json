  "task_summary": "Perceive the T-block and goal outline, approach and align to the block, establish gentle contact with the circular end-effector, push the block along a straight direction toward the fixed target, verify alignment at the goal, and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar workspace into a marked target outline. The behavior prioritizes robust perception, careful approach, contact establishment without grasping, a single straight push, and verification near the goal before retreat. Control and observation run at 10 Hz, so action timeouts use short bins consistent with rapid cycles.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear and dry", "Robot is homed and calibrated", "Camera view contains both block and goal outline", "End-effector is free of debris", "Planner has permission to operate at table height"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect the T-block pose", "Detect the goal outline pose", "Move above the block", "Align push direction relative to the block", "Lower until contact to create a stable pushing interaction", "Set yaw for desired push direction", "Execute a straight push toward the goal", "Verify alignment at the goal outline", "Retreat to a safe height"],
    "success_criteria": ["Blockâ€™s footprint overlaps the goal outline within small tolerance", "No loss of contact during push", "Robot ends safely clear of objects"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception dropouts: retry object/goal detection", "Early contact or slip: re-approach and re-align then push again", "Blocked path: retreat, re-align, and attempt reduced distance push"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the block is aligned at the goal and the robot has retreated to a safe offset."
