  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a white workspace to a fixed, outlined target T. The behavior runs at 10 Hz sensing and control. The robot first detects the block and the target outline, moves above the block, aligns orientation for a straight push, gently makes contact, and performs three short pushes to advance the block along the desired direction. After motion, the arm retreats to clear the workspace, leaving the block near the target.",

      "Workspace is clear except the T block and the target outline",
