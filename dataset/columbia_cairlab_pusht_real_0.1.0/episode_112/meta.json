  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block to a fixed T-outline target visible on the work surface. The sequence begins with visual detection of both the block and the target, followed by a guarded approach to establish contact without lifting. The tool yaw is set to align the push direction, and a single continuous push translates the block toward the target. After pushing, the system verifies that the block overlaps the target outline and then retreats to clear the workspace. Constraints include fixed 10 Hz control/observation and gentle contact before pushing.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear and the block and target outline are visible.", "Robot is homed and above the table within the task workspace.", "End-effector is equipped for planar pushing and calibrated.", "Safety limits for force and motion are active."],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect the T-block and target outline.", "Move above the block and align laterally.", "Lower gently until contact is detected.", "Set yaw to align push direction and push left toward the target.", "Check that the block is at the target and retreat."],
    "success_criteria": ["Block pose overlaps the target outline within planar tolerance.", "No loss of contact or excessive rotation during the push.", "Robot ends in a safe, retracted pose."],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, rescan and retry detection.", "If contact is not detected, repeat guarded lowering with small offsets.", "If push overshoots or misaligns, realign and perform a corrective micro-push.", "If the block rotates unexpectedly, re-approach at a different contact point."],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful placement verification and retreat, or after a safety timeout."
