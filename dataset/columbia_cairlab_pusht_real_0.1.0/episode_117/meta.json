  "task_summary": "Perceive the T-shaped block, approach and establish gentle contact with a circular tool, push it along a diagonal path toward the fixed T-outline target, then verify final alignment and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block toward a fixed target outline on the workspace. The sequence begins with perception and localization, followed by a safe approach from above and alignment to the blockâ€™s edge. After establishing contact, the tool yaw is set for side pushing. Multiple short pushes move the block toward the target, ending with a brief alignment near the target outline and a retreat to clear the scene. Timing is modest, suitable for 10 Hz observation/control, but enforced via action timeouts.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear and flat", "T-shaped block is on the table", "Target outline is visible on the surface", "End-effector calibrated and homed"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect or scan to localize the T-shaped block", "Move above and align to a push-friendly edge with tight tolerance", "Lower until contact with low force", "Set yaw for lateral pushing", "Execute several push segments toward the target direction", "Fine-align near the target outline", "Retreat to a safe distance"],
    "success_criteria": ["Block overlaps the target outline within small pose error", "No loss of contact during push segments", "End-effector retreats clear of the block and target"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If the block is not visible, raster scan and retry", "If contact is not detected, re-approach and reattempt pushing", "If the block deviates, re-align and perform additional short pushes"],
    "termination": "Tree succeeds when final alignment near the target completes and the robot retreats; it fails if perception or motion steps exceed retries or timeouts."
