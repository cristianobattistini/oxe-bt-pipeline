  "task_summary": "Perceive the T-shaped block and goal, approach and align the circular end-effector to the block, establish gentle contact, then execute repeated push motions to drive the block toward the fixed goal before retreating.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A robot arm with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar workspace to a fixed target marker while maintaining contact-based control. The scene shows a red T block, a blue goal outline on the table, and a UR-like arm approaching from above-left. Constraints include planar pushing, alignment before contact, limited push distances per stroke, and recovery via re-approach between strokes. Observation and control occur at 10 Hz but no explicit hard time limits are given.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear and planar",
      "T-shaped block and goal marker are visible",

      "Locate the T-shaped block and the goal marker",
      "Move above and align to the blockâ€™s edge in the intended push direction",

      "Execute a push stroke of fixed length toward the goal",
      "Retreat slightly and re-align; repeat strokes",
      "Finish by moving toward the goal region and retreating"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Block translated into the goal region",
      "No loss of contact during each push stroke",
      "Arm retreats safely after task"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If perception fails, rescan the workspace",
      "If contact is lost mid-push, retreat and re-approach",
      "If alignment drifts, re-run ApproachAndAlign before next stroke"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after final retreat once the planned push cycles are executed and the goal zone has been reached visually."
