    "overview": "A table-top pushing task with a UR-style arm and a circular (blue) tool. The robot must push a T-shaped block across a smooth white surface toward a fixed goal region. The plan emphasizes reliable perception followed by careful approach, tool yaw alignment, and controlled contact prior to the main push. The tree includes a fallback to scan when the object is not immediately visible, tight alignment tolerance for stable contact, and a timed push followed by a short retreat and hold.",
