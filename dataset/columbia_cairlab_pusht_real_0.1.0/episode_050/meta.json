  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-type arm with a cylindrical end-effector must push a T-shaped block into a drawn T-shaped target outline on a tabletop. The robot first ensures the block is visible, localizes the target outline, and approaches above the block. It then aligns and executes a sequence of pushes (left, up, and a diagonal settling push) to seat the block inside the outline. After verifying final pose, the robot retreats and pauses. Control/observation run at 10 Hz; the policy uses short timeouts and small alignment tolerance.",

    "success_criteria": ["Block footprint overlaps the T outline with small pose error", "No further contact after retreat", "No collisions with fixtures"],

    "termination": "Tree succeeds when the IsAt(target_T) condition passes after the push sequence, followed by a clean retreat."
