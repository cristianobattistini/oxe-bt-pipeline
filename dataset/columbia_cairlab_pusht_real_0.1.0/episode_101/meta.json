  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a red T-shaped block on white background with a printed blue T outline marking the target pose. A UR-style arm with a circular end-effector must push the block until it overlaps the target outline. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception of both the block and goal, careful approach and yaw alignment, then one or more straight pushes. After motion, the system verifies final placement and safely retreats to clear the workspace. Observation and control operate at 10 Hz; timeouts are binned to conservative values.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear except for the T-block and printed target outline.",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If detection fails, retry perception up to 3 times.",
      "If push is insufficient, the repeated push cycle provides additional travel.",
      "If final location check fails, the tree can re-enter push (operator restart) or adjust yaw."
