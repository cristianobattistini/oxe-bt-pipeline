    "overview": "A robot with a circular end-effector pushes a T-shaped block across a white tabletop into a fixed target outline. The block begins on the right side of the workspace, while a blue T-shaped outline marks the goal near the left-center. The behavior first ensures the block is visible, then approaches from above, orients the tool, and aligns to a straight pushing face. A single long push moves the block toward the target. After motion settles, the arm pauses briefly and retreats to clear the scene. Control and observation occur at 10 Hz.",
