    "overview": "A UR-style arm with a circular end-effector pushes a T-shaped block on a tabletop toward a fixed target marker. The sequence first detects the block and the goal, approaches above the block, aligns to make gentle side contact, orients the tool yaw, and executes two pushes (diagonal then lateral) to drive the block into the target region. The scene is planar; no grasping is required. The control cadence is effectively discrete, with short motions consistent with ~10 Hz perception/control.",
