  "task_summary": "Detect the T-block and goal outline, approach and align for a face-contact push, yaw the TCP to a straight-on heading, execute a single long push toward the goal, verify final alignment at the goal outline, settle briefly, and retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block into a marked target outline. The robot first perceives the red T and the blue outline, then approaches to a safe height, aligns precisely to establish a straight push, and yaw-orients the tool. A single long push translates the T toward the outline. After motion, the robot verifies alignment near the target, briefly waits for settling at 10 Hz operation, and retreats to a safe distance. No grasping is used; the interaction is pure pushing with planar contact.",

      "Workspace clear; block and target outline present on the table",
