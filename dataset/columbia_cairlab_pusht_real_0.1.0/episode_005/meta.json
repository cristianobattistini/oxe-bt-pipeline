  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop manipulation scene shows a UR-style arm with a cylindrical (circular) end-effector pushing a red T-shaped block across a white surface toward a drawn T outline. The robot must perceive both the block and the target region, align its tool to the push direction, and move the block by controlled, short pushes. The plan favors simple perception plus iterative pushes with bounded timeouts. After reaching the target, the robot briefly stabilizes and retreats to clear the workspace. Timing constraints suggest a modest control cadence, but execution relies on discrete BT ticks.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear around the T block and target outline",
      "Camera provides sufficient visibility of block and target",

      "Refine with shorter pushes; add a slight diagonal push if needed.",
      "Verify target visibility and alignment near the outline.",
      "Wait briefly and retreat to a safe distance."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Block rests within the target T outline with acceptable orientation",
      "No collisions with fixtures or table edges",
      "Robot ends in a safe, non-contact pose"

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If object not detected: re-run detection or adjust view.",
      "If misaligned: re-run alignment step before pushing.",
      "If overshoot: perform corrective push in opposite direction.",
      "If slip occurs: reduce push distance and retry."
    ],
