  "task_summary": "Detect the T-shaped block and the goal outline, approach and align the circular end-effector to a push pose, orient yaw, execute one long and one fine push toward the target, then retreat and wait.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop pushing task: a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block into a fixed T-outline target. The robot first perceives the block and the goal, moves above and precisely aligns to the block, sets its yaw to push along the required diagonal, and executes a two-stage push (coarse then fine) to settle the block inside the target outline. Finally, it retreats to clear the workspace. The scene includes a UR-style manipulator, a red T-block, and a drawn T-outline on a white table.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear and reachable",
      "Camera provides visibility of block and target",

      "Block centroid and orientation match the T-outline within tolerance",
