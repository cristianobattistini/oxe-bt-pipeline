  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A robot with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block into a marked target outline on a tabletop. The contact sheet shows perception, approach, alignment, a directional push, and final retreat. The behavior emphasizes reliable detection, gentle alignment before contact, and a single continuous push towards the goal. The target appears as a drawn outline on the surface. The plan assumes 10 Hz control/observation but encodes timing through conservative action timeouts. Success is defined by the block seated within the outline with the robot safely retracted.",
