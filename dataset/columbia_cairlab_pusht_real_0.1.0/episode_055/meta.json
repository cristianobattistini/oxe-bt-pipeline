  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a flat white table until it reaches a fixed goal region. The behavior emphasizes perception of the block, safe approach above it, alignment of the tool orientation, and a single controlled push along a chosen direction. Timing is modest and compatible with 10 Hz control/observation. After motion, the robot retreats to clear the area. Visual evidence shows approach, contact, sustained pushing, and final disengagement.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace clear except for the T-block and table",
      "Controller active at 10 Hz",

      "Execute a push of fixed distance toward the target.",

    "success_criteria": [
      "T-block translated in the intended direction by the required distance",
