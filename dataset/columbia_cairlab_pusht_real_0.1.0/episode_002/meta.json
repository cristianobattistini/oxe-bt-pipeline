  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar tabletop to a marked goal. The behavior first perceives both the block and the goal, then approaches above the block and aligns to a pushing edge. After establishing light contact, the robot sets its yaw and performs segmented pushes to steer and translate the block, matching the motion visible in the frames. The sequence concludes with a short retreat to clear the workspace. Perception and actuation are assumed to run at 10 Hz.",

      "Workspace is clear and flat",
