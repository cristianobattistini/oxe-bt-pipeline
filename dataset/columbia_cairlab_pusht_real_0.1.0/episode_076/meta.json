  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm with a circular end-effector pushes a T-shaped block across a planar white workspace until it reaches a marked target zone. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception of the block and goal, careful approach and alignment to the block’s stem, establishing gentle contact, and executing a primary push followed by a short corrective push near the goal. Success is confirmed by a pose/region check, after which the robot retreats to a safe standoff. Observation and control are effectively discrete at 10 Hz.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear except for the T-block and the marked target zone",

      "Re-align near the goal and perform a short corrective push",

    "success_criteria": [
      "Block’s footprint overlaps the target zone",

      "Timeouts: abort sequence and retreat"

    "termination": "Tree succeeds when the block is detected at the target zone and the robot completes the retreat; it fails on unrecoverable perception or motion timeouts."
