  "task_summary": "Perceive the T-block and target, approach with a circular end-effector, establish gentle contact, push along a short 2-segment path to align the block to the target outline, then retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm with a circular tool must push a T-shaped block to a fixed target outline on a tabletop. The plan first localizes both the block and the goal, then approaches above the block, aligns the tool, lowers until contact, and executes a two-segment push to seat the block inside the target outline. The interaction is non-prehensile (no grasp). Timeouts bound each stage, with gentle contact before pushing and a brief settle wait after retreat.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot workspace clear and calibrated", "Block and goal area visible to perception", "End-effector circular tool installed", "Table surface low-friction but stable"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Scan and detect the T-block and goal outline", "Move above and align to the push direction", "Lower until contact with low force", "Perform first long push toward the goal", "Perform a short orthogonal push for final alignment", "Retreat and briefly wait"],
    "success_criteria": ["Block pose overlaps target outline within visual tolerance", "No loss of contact during push segments", "Tool retreats clear of the object at end"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, rescan the scene", "If misalignment occurs, re-approach and realign before re-pushing", "If contact not detected within bounds, reset height and try again"],
    "termination": "Terminate after successful alignment and a clean retreat with the tool clear of the block."
