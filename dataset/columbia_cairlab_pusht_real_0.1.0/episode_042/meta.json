  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm with a cylindrical (circular) tool must push a red T-shaped block across a white tabletop into a marked goal region. The contact sheet shows approach from different sides, alignment near a block face, and progressive motion of the T. The behavior requires robust perception of both the block and the goal, accurate in-plane yaw alignment, and controlled push distances. Actions run at 10 Hz observation/control cadence with short timeouts. After an initial push, the robot verifies progress; if not yet in the goal, it executes a smaller corrective push, then retreats to clear the workspace.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear except for the T-shaped block and goal outline.",

      "Execute a primary push of moderate distance.",
      "Re-perceive the scene; if not at goal, perform a shorter corrective push.",
