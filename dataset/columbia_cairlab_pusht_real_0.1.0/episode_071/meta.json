  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm with a circular tool must push a T-shaped block across a flat white surface to a fixed target mark. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception, safe approach without grasping, orientation alignment to the block’s side, and a controlled push along a single direction. The contact sheet shows initial perception, side alignment, sustained pushing, and final retreat. Observation and control run at 10 Hz; we select moderate timeouts and a precise alignment tolerance to keep the push stable without overconstraining execution.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear of obstacles", "T-shaped block is on the table", "Target mark exists on the surface", "Arm is homed and tool is free (no grasp)"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["If the block is not immediately visible, scan the workspace", "Detect the block pose", "Move above the block at safe height", "Set tool yaw for lateral pushing", "Approach and align to the side of the T with tight tolerance", "Push the block toward the target direction", "Retreat to a safe pose and pause briefly"],
    "success_criteria": ["Block center reaches the goal region", "No collision with non-target objects", "Continuous contact during the push without slipping"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Block not visible → raster scan and retry detection", "Misalignment before push → re-run ApproachAndAlign", "Insufficient displacement → repeat Push with same direction"],
    "termination": "End after retreat once the push action completes and the robot is idle."
