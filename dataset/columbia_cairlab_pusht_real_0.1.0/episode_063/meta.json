  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm with a circular end-effector pushes a T-shaped block across a flat table into a marked target outline. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception of both the block and the goal area, alignment of tool yaw to push direction, and incremental pushes to manage stick–slip and orientation drift. Short waits between pushes allow state observation at 10 Hz, while conservative timeouts ensure safety. The scene contains the robot, a red T block, and a blue target outline on a white tabletop.",

      "Workspace is clear except for the T-block and the marked target area",
