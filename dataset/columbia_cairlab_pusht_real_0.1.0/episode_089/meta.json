  "task_summary": "Perceive the T-shaped block and the target outline, approach and align the circular end-effector, execute three small leftward pushes to translate the block, verify at the target, then retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop robot with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block into a fixed target outline visible on the surface. The behavior emphasizes reliable perception of both the block and the target, conservative approach with tight alignment, and incremental pushing to reduce slip. After multiple short pushes, the system verifies that the block is within tolerance of the target and then retreats to a safe standoff. Observation and control occur at 10 Hz but are abstracted by action timeouts and repeats. No grasping is used; only planar pushing.",
    "preconditions": ["Robot calibrated and homed", "Workspace clear with single T-shaped block present", "Target outline drawn and static", "End-effector height calibrated for planar pushing", "Vision available for block and target detection"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect or scan for the T block and the target", "Move above the block and set orientation", "Approach and align tightly to establish contact", "Execute three incremental pushes leftward with short waits", "Verify alignment at the target and retreat"],
    "success_criteria": ["Block pose overlaps target outline within ~1 cm planar tolerance", "Orientation of the T aligns with the outline within acceptable yaw error", "Robot retreats without disturbing the final pose"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If the block or target is not visible, perform a raster scan", "If the push under- or overshoots, repeat incremental pushes", "If contact is lost, re-approach and realign before pushing again"],
    "termination": "Terminate when the IsAt(target_zone) condition is satisfied or after the planned repeats and verification complete."
