  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A table-top robot with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block into a marked target area. The contact sheet shows the arm approaching, touching the block, pushing it along the plane, and then withdrawing. The plan prioritizes reliable perception and alignment before a single continuous push. Control runs effectively at low latency, so short timeouts and minimal waiting are used. No grasping occurs; only planar contact, push, and retreat are required. A retry wrapper is used on the initial search to handle brief occlusions.",
