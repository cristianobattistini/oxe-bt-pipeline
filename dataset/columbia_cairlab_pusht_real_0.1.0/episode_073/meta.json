    "overview": "A fixed-arm robot with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block into a fixed target outline on a tabletop. The sequence begins with visual detection of both the block and the goal. The robot approaches above the block, aligns its tool orientation for effective contact, and executes multi-directional pushes to translate and orient the block into the outline. Short retreats and re-approaches maintain safe contact. Control and observation run at 10 Hz; timeouts limit each motion primitive.",
