  "task_summary": "Detect the T-shaped block and the target, align the circular tool to the block, push it along a planned direction toward the target, then retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style robot with a circular end-effector interacts with a red T-shaped block on a white tabletop. A blue drawn circle on the surface serves as the goal region, and a light blue T outline provides alignment context. The behavior emphasizes visual detection, alignment with tight tolerance, a single directed push, and a short retreat to avoid accidental contact after motion. Both observation and control are effectively discrete at 10 Hz, so actions should be brief and robust to small pose noise.",
    "preconditions": ["Camera provides view of table and objects", "T block present on table", "Goal region visible on the surface", "Robot free of collisions and within reach"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Detect T block", "Detect/confirm target region", "Verify block visibility", "Approach and align tool to a pushing edge with tight tolerance", "Set the tool yaw for a straight push", "Execute a straight push toward the target", "Retreat away from the block", "Short wait to settle"],
    "success_criteria": ["Block centroid ends within the goal region", "No grasp; strictly push-based interaction", "Robot retreats clear of the object and target area"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["Perception miss → retry detection", "Misalignment → re-approach and align with tighter tolerance", "Insufficient motion → repeat push with same direction", "Unexpected contact → retreat and re-detect"],
    "termination": "Terminate when push completes and robot has retreated with no active contact."
