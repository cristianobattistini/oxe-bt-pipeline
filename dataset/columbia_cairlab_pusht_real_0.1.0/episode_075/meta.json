  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop robot with a circular end-effector must push a gray T-shaped block to a marked target area. The sequence begins with perception of both the block and goal, followed by precise alignment. After establishing contact, the robot performs short, repeatable pushes that translate the T along orthogonal directions to approximate a diagonal path toward the goal. Motions are conservative to maintain control at 10 Hz sensing/control. The run ends with a short retreat to clear the view.",
