  "task_summary": "Detect the T-block and goal marker, approach and align to the block, make contact, then execute repeated pushes toward the fixed goal until the block reaches it; finally retreat.",
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar workspace to a circular goal marker. The robot first ensures both the block and goal are visible, approaches to a safe height, precisely aligns to the block’s side, and gently lowers until contact. It then issues a few incremental pushes in a consistent direction toward the goal, briefly pausing between pushes to stabilize perception. Success is verified by checking the block’s proximity to the goal, after which the robot retreats.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear and planar", "T-block and goal marker are present on the table", "End-effector calibrated; pushing feasible"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Perceive block and goal (fallback to scanning if not visible)", "Move above block and align precisely", "Lower until contact is detected", "Perform several short pushes toward the goal with brief pauses", "Verify block is at goal", "Retreat and wait"],
    "success_criteria": ["Block center (or reference point) lies within the goal tolerance", "No loss of contact causing unintended motion", "End-effector safely retreats after completion"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If perception fails: scan again", "If alignment/contact fails: re-align and retry", "If block stalls short of goal: repeat push sequence", "If overshoot detected: re-approach from opposite side (future extension)"],
    "termination": "Terminate when IsAt(goal_A) is true and retreat completes."
