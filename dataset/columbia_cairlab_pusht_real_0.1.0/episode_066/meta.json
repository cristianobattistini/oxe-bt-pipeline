    "overview": "A UR-style arm with a circular tool must push a T-shaped block to a fixed target outline on a planar tabletop. The robot first perceives the block and the goal, approaches to a safe pre-contact height, aligns its tool to the block’s pushing face, and then performs a primary long push followed by a shorter corrective push to seat the block inside the target shape. After confirming alignment near the goal, the arm retreats clear of the workspace. Control/observation nominally occur at 10 Hz.",

      "Workspace is clear except for the T-block and the goal outline",
