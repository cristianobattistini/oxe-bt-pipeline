  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar workspace until it reaches a marked target area. The sequence begins with perception of both the block and the target, followed by an overhead approach and fine in-plane alignment. The tool yaw is set to a convenient orientation and a single long push is executed toward the target. After motion, the system verifies proximity to the goal and safely retreats, respecting 10 Hz sensing/control constraints.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear and the T-block is on the table.",
