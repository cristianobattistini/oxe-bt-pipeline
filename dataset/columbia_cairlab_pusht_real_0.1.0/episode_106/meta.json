    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a white tabletop until it matches a target region. The contact sheet shows the red T initially to the right and a blue T-outline on the left, used as a proxy target. The robot approaches, aligns its yaw, performs a long push, briefly re-aligns, then executes a fine push. The sequence assumes 10 Hz sensing and control, favoring short timeouts and tight alignment to maintain stable contact during planar pushing.",

      "Execute a long push toward the target (≈0.2 m, 180°).",
      "Re-align to correct drift and orientation.",
      "Execute a fine push (≈0.1 m, 180°).",
