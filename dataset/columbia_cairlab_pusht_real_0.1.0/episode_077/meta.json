  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop pushing task: a robot arm with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a white workspace until it reaches a small goal mark. The sequence emphasizes visual detection, top-down approach, precise in-plane alignment, controlled contact, repeated straight pushes, and a safe retreat. The frames show the block starting left of the goal and the arm approaching from above before executing a rightward push. Timing is moderate; actions are tuned with conservative timeouts and precise alignment tolerance.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace clear; block and goal mark visible",

      "Retreat to a safe standoff"

    "success_criteria": [
      "Block final pose within a small radius of the goal mark",

      "If the block is not detected: rescan the area",

      "If the push deviates: realign and repeat a shorter push"
    ],
    "termination": "Terminate after retreat once pushes are executed or if any action times out/fails irrecoverably."
