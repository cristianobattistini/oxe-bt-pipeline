  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a red, T-shaped block onto a T-shaped target outline on a white tabletop. The behavior emphasizes perception of both the movable block and the target, a gentle approach, yaw alignment of the tool, and two staged push directions to translate and fine-position the block. Observations suggest initial approach from the right/top, contact near the block’s stem, then progressive pushing with small distances. Timing budgets use 400–1500 ms bins and short repeats to converge.",
