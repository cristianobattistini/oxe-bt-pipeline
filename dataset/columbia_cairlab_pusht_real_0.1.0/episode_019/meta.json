  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop pushing task with a UR-style arm and a circular end-effector. The robot must observe a T-shaped block, localize a fixed goal mark on the workspace, approach the block, orient its tool, verify contact gently, and perform a straight push so the block moves toward the goal area. The sequence favors robust perception (visibility check with recovery scan), precise alignment, and a guarded approach before a single long push. The scene shows a red T block and a drawn circular goal.",

    "success_criteria": ["Block translates toward/into the marked goal region", "No loss of contact before the planned push distance", "Robot ends in a safe, non-contact pose"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If block not visible, re-detect it", "If goal not visible, raster scan to find it", "If contact not detected, re-approach and retry the push once"],
    "termination": "Tree returns SUCCESS after completing the push and retreat; returns FAILURE if perception or push repeatedly fail."
