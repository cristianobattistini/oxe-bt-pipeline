    "overview": "A tabletop pushing task: a robotic arm with a cylindrical (circular) tool must drive a T-shaped block along the plane to a drawn target marker. The scene shows a red T-block and a blue outline target on a white tabletop. The robot first detects the block and goal, moves above and aligns to the block, orients its tool to a push-friendly yaw, and executes a straight push of moderate distance toward the goal. After motion, it checks proximity to the goal region and then retreats to a safe standoff. Visual feedback and retries are used during perception.",

      "Camera calibrated; workspace clear.",
      "T-block and target marker are visible in the camera view.",
