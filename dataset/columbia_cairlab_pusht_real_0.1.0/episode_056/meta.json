    "overview": "A fixed tabletop scene shows a robot with a circular end-effector pushing a T-shaped block toward a drawn goal outline. The behavior requires reliable perception of both the block and the target, precise approach, orientation setting, and a two-stage push (coarse then fine) to achieve final placement. Movements should remain planar, with brief dwell and retreat after success. The dataset runs at 10 Hz observation/control, implying short timeouts and reactive updates.",
