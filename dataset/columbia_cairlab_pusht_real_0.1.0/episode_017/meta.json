    "overview": "A fixed camera shows a tabletop with a red T-shaped block and a small circular goal mark on the right. A 6-DoF arm with a cylindrical/rounded tool approaches, makes contact, and pushes the block. The behavior tree performs perception with recovery scanning, moves above the object, aligns laterally for a push, executes one long push and, if needed, a short corrective push, then verifies the goal and retreats. Observation/control are conceptually 10 Hz but not parameterized in the node ports.",
