  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style arm with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar workspace into a marked target region. The system first perceives the block and the goal, approaches from above, and aligns its tool to establish stable pushing contact. The tool yaw is set to match the intended motion direction. The robot performs a primary push to translate the block toward the goal and a secondary shorter push for fine placement. Finally, the arm retreats and pauses. Observations and control operate at 10 Hz.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear of obstacles", "Block and goal marker are within camera view", "Robot is homed and reachable", "Friction sufficient for pushing without slip"],
