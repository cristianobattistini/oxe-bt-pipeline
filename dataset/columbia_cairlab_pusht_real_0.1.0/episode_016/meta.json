  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-like arm with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar white workspace until it reaches a marked target region. The behavior tree first ensures the block is perceived; if not, it performs a raster scan. The arm moves to a safe height above the block, aligns precisely, orients the tool, and executes a single diagonal push. After the push, the goal region is checked for visibility as a proxy for contextual verification, and the arm retreats to clear the scene. Observations and control are effectively discrete at 10 Hz.",
