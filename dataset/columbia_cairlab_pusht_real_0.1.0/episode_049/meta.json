  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop scene shows a red T-shaped block and a drawn T target outline. A robot with a circular end-effector pushes the block to match the target. The behavior detects both entities, approaches above the block, aligns the tool for a leftward push, and executes several short pushes to translate and orient the block into the marked goal area. Fine positioning is achieved by a final micro-push, then the robot retreats to clear the workspace. Observation and control run at 10 Hz, so actions should remain stable between cycles.",
