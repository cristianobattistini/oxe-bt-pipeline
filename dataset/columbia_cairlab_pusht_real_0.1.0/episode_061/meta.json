  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base robot with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a white tabletop to a marked goal. The sequence begins with perception of both the block and the goal, followed by a top-approach and fine alignment to establish a good pushing contact. The arm then performs a directional push that moves the T toward the goal region. After motion, the system re-perceives the block to confirm placement before retreating to a safe pose. Observations and control are effectively discrete at 10 Hz.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear except for the red T block and the blue circular goal marker.", "Camera/extrinsics calibrated so DetectObject can localize block and goal.", "Robot reachable workspace includes both current block pose and goal area.", "End-effector is free and safe to contact the object (pushing only)."],

      "Perceive t_block and target_zone.",

      "Retreat to create clearance."

      "Misalignment or slip during push → repeat alignment then push again.",
      "Undershoot/overshoot → perform additional small corrective pushes."
