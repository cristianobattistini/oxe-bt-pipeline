  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a circular blue end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a white tabletop to a marked target. Visual confirmation of both the block and target is required before contact. The robot approaches from above, aligns its yaw for a directed push, performs a single deliberate push stroke, then verifies that the block reached the target area. Movements should be precise and time-bounded; perception can be retried. Finally, the arm retreats to clear the workspace.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear except for the T-shaped block and a visible target marker",
      "Camera provides views enabling DetectObject for both block and target",

    "termination": "Tree succeeds when IsAt(target_marker) is true after the push; otherwise it fails. In both cases, the arm performs a short retreat and wait."
