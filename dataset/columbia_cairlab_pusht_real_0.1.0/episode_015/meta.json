  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-type arm with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a white tabletop into a marked target slot. The behavior prioritizes perception of both the block and the goal, careful approach with yaw alignment, and a pair of directional pushes to translate and slightly reorient the T. The controller runs at low latency; the BT sequences deterministic steps and allows limited retries for perception. Success is confirmed by checking the block’s presence at the goal before the arm retreats clear.",

      "Robot is homed and workspace is clear.",
