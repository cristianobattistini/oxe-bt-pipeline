  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style robotic arm with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar workspace into a marked goal region. The sequence is perceive → approach → orient → push → verify → retreat. The arm operates at 10 Hz observation/control rates. Visual detection may fail due to occlusions or lighting; thus scanning is included. The push direction is approximately along the table’s +X (rightward) axis as suggested by the contact sheet. The policy retries the push sequence up to three times before terminating.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear and the robot is homed.",
      "T-shaped block is on the table within reachable workspace.",

      "Set yaw to align pushing direction toward the goal.",
      "Execute a rightward push for a fixed distance.",
      "Check that the block is at the goal; retry sequence if not.",

      "The T-block’s pose lies within the goal region bounds.",
      "No collision with table edges or fixtures.",

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Perception failure → perform raster ScanForTarget.",

      "Misalignment → realign via ApproachAndAlign before each retry."
    ],
