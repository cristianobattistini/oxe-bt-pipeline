  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block into a fixed T-outline on a white tabletop. The sequence begins with perception of the block and the goal outline, then a top-approach and fine alignment to establish a good pushing contact. The tool orientation is set for lateral pushing. Two controlled pushes translate and nudge the block into the target outline. The robot verifies final pose relative to the outline, briefly waits to dissipate motion, and retreats. Visual cues dominate; both observation and control operate at 10 Hz.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace clear except for the T-shaped block and goal outline",
      "Camera provides sufficient view of block and outline",

      "Apply a short orthogonal push to fine-seat the block.",
      "Re-align against the outline and check goal pose.",
      "Wait briefly and retreat."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Block lies within the T-shaped outline with small pose error",
      "No unintended rotation or overshoot after settling",
      "Robot safely retreats with no contact"

      "Perception miss: re-run detection or expand search area",
      "Insufficient contact: re-approach and realign before pushing",
      "Overshoot or misalignment: apply corrective, shorter push",
      "Object slip: reduce push distance on retry"
    ],
    "termination": "Task ends when the block is verified at the target outline, settling wait completes, and the robot retreats."
