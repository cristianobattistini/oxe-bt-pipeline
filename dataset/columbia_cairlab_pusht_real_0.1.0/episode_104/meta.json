  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a planar work surface into a marked goal pose. The robot first perceives both the block and the goal outline, approaches to a safe height, and aligns to the block’s stem. It sets a pushing yaw and executes short push segments, re-detecting as needed to stay on course. The scene contains a single block and a fixed, printed goal mark. Timeouts, discrete tolerances, and limited retries improve robustness at 10 Hz operation.",
