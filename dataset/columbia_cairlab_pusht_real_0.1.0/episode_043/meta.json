  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop robot with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a white workspace to a designated target region. The sequence begins with perception to locate the block, followed by an overhead approach and yaw alignment for a planar push. The robot performs a straight push with moderate distance, then retreats and waits briefly. Contact-rich grasping is not required; precision alignment ensures sliding without toppling. Visual feedback is used to confirm visibility before motion. Safety timeouts are used on motion leaves.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace is clear except for the T-block and a target mark", "Camera provides view of the block", "Robot is homed and within reach of the workspace", "End-effector is unobstructed"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Scan or detect the T-block", "Verify it is visible", "Move above the block at a safe offset", "Set tool yaw aligned with push direction", "Approach and align to the push start pose", "Execute a straight push of fixed distance", "Retreat from the object", "Short wait to stabilize"],
    "success_criteria": ["T-block translated in the commanded direction by the planned distance", "No object topples or exits workspace", "Robot ends clear of the block", "All actions complete within timeouts"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If DetectObject fails, perform a raster ScanForTarget", "If visibility is lost, re-detect then continue", "If alignment times out, retry the approach step", "If push is obstructed, abort and retreat"],
    "termination": "Tree terminates after retreat and wait once the push action completes or any unrecoverable failure occurs."
