  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base robot with a circular blue end-effector must push a red T-shaped block across a white table into a T-shaped target outline drawn on the surface. The robot first detects both the block and the target, approaches the block, aligns its tool yaw for planar pushing, and executes a series of short pushes in a consistent direction. After progress, it verifies alignment against the target outline and finally retreats to a safe height. Control and observation are discrete (10 Hz), so actions use modest timeouts and repeated pushes to accumulate motion.",
