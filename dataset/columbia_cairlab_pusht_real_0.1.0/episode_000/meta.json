  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop pushing task with a UR-style arm: the robot must push a T-shaped block across a white surface into a fixed target region drawn on the table. The sequence begins with visual detection of the block and the target outline. The end-effector aligns its yaw to push along the desired direction, executes a coarse push to traverse most of the distance, refines alignment, and performs a short corrective push to settle the block near the goal outline. After motion completion, the robot waits briefly and retreats to clear the view for verification.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace clear; block and target outline visible",
      "Camera/extrinsics calibrated; arm homed",

      "Re-align with tighter tolerance near the goal.",
      "Execute a fine push of 0.1 m to settle at the target.",
      "Retreat and wait briefly."
