  "task_summary": "Push a T-shaped block into its outlined target region using a circular end-effector, then retract safely while maintaining 10 Hz control/observation cadence as seen in Push-T real setups.", 
  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a circular tool must push a T-shaped block so that it overlaps a marked goal region on the table, as depicted by the contact-sheet frames where the arm makes contact and sweeps the piece along planar directions [attached_image:1][web:8]. The real-world Push-T task is commonly executed with policies issuing commands at 10 Hz, which matches the stated sensing and control frequencies for this episode [attached_image:1][web:8]. The environment includes the T block, the drawn goal outline, and a clean planar workspace enabling point-contact pushes [attached_image:1][web:8]. The behavior emphasizes alignment before contact, short straight pushes, and a final retraction to clear occlusions and signal task completion [attached_image:1][web:8].",
    "preconditions": [
      "T block and goal outline are both detectable in the workspace view before approaching [attached_image:1][web:8]",
      "End-effector is collision-free above the table and ready to descend for contact [attached_image:1][web:8]",

      "Perceive the T block and the goal region; if not immediately visible, perform a short spiral scan [attached_image:1][web:8]",
      "Move above the block, align to the intended push edge, and descend slowly until contact is detected [attached_image:1][web:8]",
      "Execute one or two straight pushes to translate the block toward and into the outline while maintaining alignment [attached_image:1][web:8]",
      "Verify approximate placement, then retract to a safe height/offset to end the episode cleanly [attached_image:1][web:8]"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "The T block lies within the goal outline with acceptable overlap comparable to Push-T IoU-style thresholds used in literature [attached_image:1][web:8]",
      "The end-effector retreats clear of the object and goal region after placement [attached_image:1][web:8]"
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If the block is not detected, perform a bounded spiral scan before reattempting perception [attached_image:1][web:8]",
      "If contact is not reached within the descent limit, retreat slightly, realign, and retry approach [attached_image:1][web:8]",
      "If the push overshoots or under-shoots, execute an orthogonal corrective push followed by re-verification [attached_image:1][web:8]"
