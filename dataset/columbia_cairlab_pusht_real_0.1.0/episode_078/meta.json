  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed-base manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a tabletop into a drawn goal outline. The sequence uses perception to localize both the block and the goal, approaches from above to establish contact, aligns its yaw to set a pushing direction, and executes a set of straight pushes to seat the block inside the outline. The process assumes 10 Hz observation/control, modest timeouts, and no grasping. The robot finally retreats, leaving the block placed.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Tabletop is clear except for one T-shaped block and the goal outline",

      "Execute staged pushes to translate and orient the block into the outline",
      "Retreat and wait briefly"
