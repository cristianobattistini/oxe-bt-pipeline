  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style robot with a circular end-effector pushes a T-shaped block across a white tabletop into a target outline drawn as a blue T. The behavior alternates perception and controlled contact-based pushing. The robot first ensures the block is visible, aligns its yaw for side pushing, establishes contact, and performs two short pushes along planned directions to settle the block within the outline. Recovery uses re-scanning if the object is lost. Timing is modest; precise lateral alignment is prioritized over speed.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear with one T-shaped block on the table",
      "Blue T target outline is fixed and known as goal_T",

      "Push 0.1 m at 90° to finish alignment",
