  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed tabletop scene shows a T-shaped block that must be pushed into a T-shaped target outline. A 6-DoF arm with a circular end-effector approaches the block, aligns its yaw to push along a diagonal and executes short pushes with intermittent re-localization and re-alignment. The goal is to translate and slightly re-orient the block until it overlaps the target outline. The sequence assumes 10 Hz observation and control, modest timeouts, and precise in-plane alignment before each push. The run ends with a brief settle and a safe retreat.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Camera/extrinsics calibrated; target outline visible",
      "Tabletop is clear except the T-block and target",

    "termination": "Stop when overlap is achieved after the planned cycles and the robot executes the retreat, or when retries/timeouts exhaust."
