  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A fixed tabletop scene shows a red T-shaped block and a blue T-shaped outline that marks the goal region. A UR-style arm with a circular end-effector must push the block into the outline. The behavior first perceives the block and target, approaches from above with a small safety offset, aligns yaw for a side push, and performs three short pushes to translate the block toward the goal. After motion, the robot retreats to clear the workspace. The plan assumes moderate friction and uses short timeouts and precise alignment.",
    "preconditions": ["Workspace clear around the block and target", "Camera view contains both block and target outline", "End-effector free and above table", "Controller running at 10 Hz"],
    "stepwise_plan": ["Scan and detect the T-block", "Detect the target outline", "Move above the block with small vertical offset", "Set tool yaw to 90° for side push", "Approach and align precisely on block edge", "Repeat three short pushes leftward", "Retreat and wait briefly"],
    "success_criteria": ["Block’s pose overlaps the target outline within visual tolerance", "No collisions with robot body or table edge", "Robot retreats to a safe standoff"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, rescan within action timeout", "If alignment drifts, re-approach and align", "If push stalls, repeat short pushes or increase approach distance on next attempt"],
    "termination": "Terminate when pushes and retreat complete; success if the block visually overlaps the target outline."
