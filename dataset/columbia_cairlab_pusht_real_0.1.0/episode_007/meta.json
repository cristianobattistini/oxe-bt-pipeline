  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop pushing task is executed by a robot with a circular end-effector. The scene contains a T-shaped block and a drawn T-shaped goal outline. The robot first ensures both the block and the goal are visible, then approaches above the block, aligns its TCP yaw, and performs a primary push toward the goal. Near the goal, it performs a fine alignment and, if not yet correctly placed, issues a short corrective push before verifying placement and retreating. Timeouts are moderate to accommodate accurate alignment; tolerances are tight for precise placement.",
    "preconditions": [
