  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "The scene shows a UR-series arm with a round pusher interacting with a red T-shaped block on a tabletop and a faint target outline, which matches the Real-World Push‑T task definition. The goal is to make stable contact, align the T block with the goal region, and execute short corrective pushes until the T is fully within the target before retreating to avoid occlusion or perturbation. The literature describes this as a multi-stage push followed by an end-effector move-away, commonly run near 10 Hz command/update rates. [web:16][web:17][web:7]",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot and camera calibrated for tabletop Push‑T station with visible target outline. [web:16][web:17]",
      "End-effector configured as a round pusher and safe heights defined. [web:16]",
      "Perception can localize T block and goal outline with sufficient accuracy for closed-loop corrections. [web:16][web:17]",

      "Execute short directional pushes with intermittent re-alignment to progressively seat the T inside the goal outline. [web:16][web:17]",
      "Verify final alignment relative to the goal and then retreat the tool to a safe end-zone to avoid occlusion. [web:16][web:17]"

    "success_criteria": [
      "T block’s footprint fully lies within the goal outline at episode end, consistent with Push‑T evaluation. [web:17][web:16]",

      "Loss of visual tracking or partial occlusion during approach; recover by rescanning in a spiral pattern. [web:16]",
