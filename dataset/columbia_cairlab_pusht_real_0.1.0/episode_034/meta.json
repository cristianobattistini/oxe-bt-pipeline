  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-type arm with a circular end-effector pushes a T-shaped block across a white tabletop toward a drawn goal outline. The robot first locates both the block and the goal, approaches to a safe height, and aligns its tool to the block’s face. It then performs a series of short, controlled pushes roughly toward the goal, re-aligning between pushes to keep contact stable. After displacement appears sufficient, the robot backs away and pauses. Frequencies are 10 Hz for observation and control; pushes are conservative in distance and time.",
