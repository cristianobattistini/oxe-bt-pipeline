  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a white planar surface until it aligns with a fixed target outline on the table. The robot first ensures both the block and the target are visible, then approaches above the block, aligns, sets a yaw suitable for pushing, and executes a straight push. After the push, the system checks if the block is at the target and retreats. The scene shows a single red T-block and a drawn target outline; the motion appears quasi-planar.",
