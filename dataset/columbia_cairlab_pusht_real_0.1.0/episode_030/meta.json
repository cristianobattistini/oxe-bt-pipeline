  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A tabletop robot with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block into a fixed target area. The contact sheet shows repeated contacts and re-alignments as the robot advances the piece in small steps. The plan emphasizes robust perception of both the block and the goal outline, alignment to a consistent pushing yaw, and multiple short pushes to refine final pose. Observation and control operate at 10 Hz; the sequence uses moderate timeouts and small tolerances for contact-safe motion.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Workspace is clear except for one T-shaped block and a marked goal outline.",
      "Robot is homed and tool is calibrated.",

      "Re-align and repeat pushes until the block reaches the target.",
      "Retreat to a safe height."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
