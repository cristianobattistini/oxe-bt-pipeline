  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A table-top manipulator with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block to a marked target outline on the workspace. The contact-sheet shows perception, approach, contact, and pushing phases, with the block ultimately relocated near the right side of the scene. The plan relies on visual detection, alignment of yaw for a straight push, gentle contact, a principal push stroke, and an optional corrective nudge, then retreat. Timing bins reflect a 10 Hz loop by choosing the nearest allowed action timeouts.",

    "success_criteria": ["T-block footprint overlaps the target outline within alignment tolerance", "No unintended collisions during motion", "Tool retreats to a safe height after pushing"],
    "failure_and_recovery": ["If detection fails, retry detections", "If contact not detected, repeat approach", "If push undershoots, perform corrective nudge", "If misalignment occurs, re-align and re-push"],
    "termination": "Terminate after the block is at the target or after completing the corrective attempt and retreat."
