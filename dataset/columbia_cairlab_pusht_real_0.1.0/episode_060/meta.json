  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "A UR-style robot with a circular end-effector must push a T-shaped block across a white tabletop until it aligns with a fixed blue T-outline. The sequence begins with vision-based detection of the block and the goal, approaches to a safe height, aligns yaw, and establishes light contact. The robot then performs one or more straight pushes to translate the block toward the outline, verifying goal proximity after each push. The process emphasizes stable contact, controlled distances, and modest timeouts at 10 Hz perception/control.",
