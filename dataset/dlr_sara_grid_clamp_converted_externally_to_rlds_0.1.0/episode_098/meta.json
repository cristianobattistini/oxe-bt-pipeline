    "overview": "A fixed manipulator with a parallel gripper must place a small grid clamp onto a slotted grid board on the workbench. The contact sheet shows approach from the left of a SARA-branded box, vertical alignment over the board, gentle downwards motion, release, and retreat. The robot may already hold the clamp; otherwise it should locate and grasp one from a nearby tray. Precise alignment and light seating force are required to avoid tilting or bouncing of the clamp before opening the gripper and backing off safely.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot powered and homed; gripper operational and calibrated",
      "Grid board area is clear and visible to perception",
      "Clamp either in gripper or available in the tray within reach"

      "If not holding a clamp, search, detect, approach above, open, compute grasp, pick, verify stability, and lift",
      "Yaw-align TCP to clamp orientation",
      "Search and detect the grid board, verify visibility, move above, and fine-align",
      "Lower until contact with low force and place the clamp on the board",
      "Open gripper to release, retreat vertically, and wait briefly"
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Clamp rests flat on the grid board within tight alignment tolerance",
      "Gripper is open and empty after placement",
      "End-effector retreats to a safe clearance height without collisions"

    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "If object not found, rescan with grid pattern and re-detect",
      "If grasp unstable, reopen, recompute grasp, and retry pick",
      "If misalignment or premature contact detected, retreat slightly, realign, and attempt placement again"
