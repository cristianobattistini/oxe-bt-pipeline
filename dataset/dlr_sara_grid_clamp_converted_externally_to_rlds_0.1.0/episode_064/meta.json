  "task_long_description": {
    "overview": "This task involves the SARA robotic arm, which starts by holding a black grid clamp. The robot's objective is to accurately place this clamp into a fixed, parallel rail fixture on the work surface. The sequence requires precise alignment, a controlled downward insertion until contact, gripper release, and a safe retreat.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Robot arm is holding the 'grid_clamp'.",
      "The 'slot_1' rail fixture is clear and accessible.",
      "Robot is in a starting 'hover' pose above the fixture."
    ],
    "stepwise_plan": [
      "Align the held clamp directly above the 'slot_1' rail fixture.",
      "Lower the clamp vertically with slow speed until it makes contact and is seated (force detected).",
      "Open the gripper to release the clamp.",
      "Retreat the arm vertically to a safe-clearance position."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "The grid clamp is successfully released and seated securely in the rail fixture.",
      "The robot arm retreats without disturbing the clamp."
    ],
    "failure_and_recovery": [
      "Failure: Clamp is dropped or misaligned. Recovery: Stop task, signal for intervention.",
      "Failure: Contact not detected during lowering (clamp missed fixture). Recovery: Stop, signal error."
