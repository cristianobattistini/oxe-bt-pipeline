    "overview": "A UR-type robot with a parallel gripper is operating over a wooden workbench with a SARA controller box and a set of small black clamps. The instruction is to place a grid clamp at a designated grid fixture position. The robot should approach above the fixture, align precisely, descend until contact, press lightly to seat the clamp, open the gripper to release, and retreat safely. The scene appears static and free of obstacles, with visual fiducials on the table aiding alignment.",
    "preconditions": [
      "Grid clamp is already held in the gripper",
      "Grid fixture target pose (goal_pose) is known or can be inferred",

      "Lower until gentle contact is detected.",
      "Execute a tolerant place motion at the goal pose with light press.",
      "Open gripper to release the clamp.",
      "Retreat upward/away to a safe distance."

    "success_criteria": [
      "Clamp is seated within the grid fixture at goal_pose within tolerance",

      "If object not detected in gripper, abort placement and request recovery pick",
