    "overview": "The scene shows a cobot at the DLR SARA workstation manipulating small dark grid clamps over a wooden or rail board surface. [web:7] The goal is to place a grid clamp at an aligned position on the board with correct yaw and gentle seating before opening the gripper. [web:7] The execution is organized as a BehaviorTree.CPP v3 XML sequence with a fallback to ensure the clamp is in hand before placing. [web:2][web:5] The tree performs perception, approach and alignment, contact‑guided lowering, placement, release, and retreat to conclude the episode. [web:2][web:7]",
