    "overview": "A 6‑DoF manipulator with a parallel gripper operates over a wooden grid board to handle a small dark clamp object placed on the table surface, approaching, grasping, transferring, and placing it with alignment to the board grid. [attached_image:1] The scene shows the arm moving from a right‑side home near the SARA base toward clustered clamps, then toward the center board region for a careful placement. [attached_image:1] The behavior emphasizes accurate approach, low force contact, and a brief press to ensure seating before opening the gripper and retreating. [attached_image:1]",
